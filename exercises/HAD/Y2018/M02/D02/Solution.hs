We have been able to download sets of articles and then we've triaged them,
but before we do triage, we have to do a bifurcation from before: we don't
want Associated Press articles showing up in our NEW / UPDATED / REDUNDANT
stacks.

Today's Haskell problem is to remove the AP articles from the downloaded
packets.

Hint: you may have seen this before in a different context.
