1,2017-04-19,590314928DE904E58E1AE20E,VICE Sports,en_ca,Kyle Lowry Had the Redemption Game Toronto Needed - VICE Sports,http://sports.vice.com/en_ca/article/yp85nj/kyle-lowry-had-the-redemption-game-toronto-needed,"<p>Two days can be a long time.</p><p>Following yet another Game 1 loss, the Toronto Raptors were forced, by schedule, to sit and wait for an opportunity to make things right, the cloud of another 0-1 series hole festering over their first-round matchup with the Milwaukee Bucks. Rest is great, and in this case Serge Ibaka's ankle probably benefitted from it, but most players say the best thing to do after a bad outing is to get back on the court and wash it away. With all that time to sit and analyze, there's plenty of room for overthinking.</p><p>That the Raptors had been here before didn't make the Game 1 loss OK by any means, but their collective experience fighting through this same type of adversity was at least able to inform how they'd approach the time between games. For DeMar DeRozan, that meant giving his co-star some space following <a href='https://sports.vice.com/ca/article/kyle-lowry-and-the-raptors-cant-waste-more-time-adjusting-to-milwaukees-game-plan'>a disastrous Game 1 performance</a>.</p><p>'Nothing,' DeRozan said between games when asked what he'd said to Lowry after the point guard went 2-of-11 from the floor in the opener. 'It's just him figuring it out. One thing, Kyle's mind works at 1,000 miles per hour. Once he settles down, he gonna figure it out.'</p><p class='article__blockquote'><b><a href='https://sports.vice.com/ca/article/the-raptors-have-never-been-in-a-better-position-to-win-the-east'>READ MORE: The Raptors Have Never Been in a Better Position to Win the East</a></b></p><p>Prior to Tuesday's tip-off, head coach Dwane Casey echoed a similar approach.</p><p>'No,' he said of a pregame sit-down talk. 'Now is not the time to go to him. He's a self-starter, he understands the situation, and I'll be very shocked if he doesn't come out and play much better.'</p><p>Lowry didn't exactly instill confidence in a bounce back on Sunday, when he said he'd approach Game 2 by being more aggressive at his teammates' behest and 'force some more shots.' The quote and attitude probably weren't indicative of Lowry's actual plan, but two years removed from a poor playoff performance and a year after a potentially elbow-related shooting slump extended through two rounds, eyes were understandably on Lowry out of the gate.</p><div class='article__media'><picture class='article__image'><source media='(max-width: 25em)' srcset='https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/04/19/kyle-lowry-bounce-back-body-image-1492614217.jpg?resize=400:*, https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/04/19/kyle-lowry-bounce-back-body-image-1492614217.jpg?resize=600:* 2x'><source media='(max-width: 40.625em)' srcset='https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/04/19/kyle-lowry-bounce-back-body-image-1492614217.jpg?resize=650:*, https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/04/19/kyle-lowry-bounce-back-body-image-1492614217.jpg?resize=975:* 2x'><source media='(max-width: 53.125em)' srcset='https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/04/19/kyle-lowry-bounce-back-body-image-1492614217.jpg?resize=850:*, https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/04/19/kyle-lowry-bounce-back-body-image-1492614217.jpg?resize=1275:* 2x'><source media='(min-width: 53.125em)' srcset='https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/04/19/kyle-lowry-bounce-back-body-image-1492614217.jpg?resize=900:*'><img src='https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/04/19/kyle-lowry-bounce-back-body-image-1492614217.jpg' alt=''></picture><p class='article__image-caption'>The Raptors' All-Star point guard was efficient and effective in Game 2. Photo by John E. Sokolowski-USA TODAY Sports</p></div><p>To call his Game 2 performance a bounce back would be a bit of an understatement, given the stakes.<br></p><p>Lowry was masterful Tuesday, scoring 22 points on just 12 field-goal attempts thanks to a pair of threes and nine trips to the free-throw line. He also added four rebounds and three steals, dished out five assists, and was a plus-7, the second-best mark in the game. It's perhaps that last number that resonates most, as Lowry's shown in the past he can be a huge positive even when his shot isn't falling, with last year's playoff on-off court numbers reaching staggering proportions despite the wayward jumper.</p><p>To hear Lowry tell it, there wasn't much of an adjustment beyond playing better.</p><p>'Just playing,' Lowry said. 'Going out there and taking my shots. Being aggressive. My teammates challenged me, like I said before, and I got to the free-throw line nine times. Got aggressive early and the second half, DeMar kind of got himself going. So we balanced well tonight. For me, it was just going out there and playing.'</p><p>He may be guilty of over-simplifying here. The Raptors did make some schematic tweaks to try to open up additional driving room for Lowry, particularly early on in the game, and Lowry responded by attacking with more vigor. He still looked shy heading into the paint on occasion—he missed a layup trying to bait a foul on Khris Middleton, passed up a look at the rim to get DeRozan a slightly better one, and picked up his dribble in the paint a couple of times looking for a pass out—but this was also a big part of the game plan, to collapse Milwaukee's length after traps and get the ball out to open shooters (the Raptors responded by hitting 14-of-29 from long range).</p><p>All told, Lowry drove 15 times in Game 2, shooting 3-of-5 on those drives, getting fouled twice, and tallying one assist, a big change from producing zero points on 10 drives in Game 1. Lowry also had three secondary assists, and combined with DeRozan's four, it was clear that those two did a better job moving the ball away from Milwaukee's exceptional length and aggression.</p><p>'That's the way they play. They kinda make you get in there, they all come to the ball, you gotta kick out,' Lowry explained. 'You gotta make shots against those guys. Their length is their strength, so once you get in the paint, they're all in there. Trying to kick out, and we gotta make shots. It was there. We watched the film and that was one of the things that was open for us, get in the paint.'</p><p>Lowry's redemption came with two big, defining, KLOE-type moments down the stretch, too. Lowry has long had a sense of the moment, and it's been his late-game heroics as much as his quarters-long surges that have ingratiated him to fans and earned him the Kyle Lowry Over Everything acronym (shout out to Zach Harper, and rest in peace Daily Dime Live). One goof with a sign in Jurassic Park aside, Lowry's earned the trust of the fan base with the game on the line, and the Air Canada Centre shook of a game-long anxious energy to dial in for the closing possessions.</p><div class='article__media'><picture class='article__image'><source media='(max-width: 25em)' srcset='https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/04/19/kyle-lowry-bounce-back-body-image-1492614044.jpg?resize=400:*, https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/04/19/kyle-lowry-bounce-back-body-image-1492614044.jpg?resize=600:* 2x'><source media='(max-width: 40.625em)' srcset='https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/04/19/kyle-lowry-bounce-back-body-image-1492614044.jpg?resize=650:*, https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/04/19/kyle-lowry-bounce-back-body-image-1492614044.jpg?resize=975:* 2x'><source media='(max-width: 53.125em)' srcset='https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/04/19/kyle-lowry-bounce-back-body-image-1492614044.jpg?resize=850:*, https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/04/19/kyle-lowry-bounce-back-body-image-1492614044.jpg?resize=1275:* 2x'><source media='(min-width: 53.125em)' srcset='https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/04/19/kyle-lowry-bounce-back-body-image-1492614044.jpg?resize=900:*'><img src='https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/04/19/kyle-lowry-bounce-back-body-image-1492614044.jpg' alt=''></picture><p class='article__image-caption'>Giannis has predictably been a handful for the Raptors as the series shifts to Milwaukee tied 1-1. Photo by John E. Sokolowski-USA TODAY Sports</p></div><p>Up two with 40 seconds to go, Lowry wound up switched onto Giannis Antetokounmpo thanks to a pair of screens from guards, and the 7-foot Greek began backing him down. It's still unclear if Lowry tried to draw a charge or pulled the chair—Casey would only say Lowry's entitled to that space—but Toronto's All-Star guard hit the floor, Antetokounmpo stumbled and couldn't take advantage of his substantial size advantage, and a swing of the ball resulted in a rushed Middleton miss.</p><p>(On the list of Lowry specialties, him guarding much bigger players in the post grades high, but expecting anything but a clean turnaround jumper here would have been asking too much.)</p><p>Still up two coming out of a timeout with 23 seconds left, Casey called DeRozan's number. Lowry had done the bulk of his damage on offense early, ceding the reins to DeRozan as the latter heated up in the second half, and so DeRozan, as he often does, got the nod. The Bucks sent two players, including Antetokounmpo, DeRozan's way, and so the ball found its way to Lowry through Ibaka. Lowry used an Ibaka screen to get some steam driving toward Malcolm Brogdon, crossed over, and pulled up from 20 feet. Four-point game.</p><div data-iframely-id='GJU3B1h' class='article__embed article__embed--iframely'><div style='left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.2493%;'><iframe style='border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;' allowfullscreen data-iframely-url='//oembed.vice.com/GJU3B1h' frameborder='0'></iframe></div></div><p>'For me, I just wanted to get to my spot,' Lowry said. 'I knew there was five seconds on the shot clock, I wanted to get to my spot. Get to my spot and let it go. At the end of the day, I work on my shot almost every day, so if I missed it, I would have still been happy because I got to my spot. But I was gonna try to make it.'<br></p><p>The clutch basket will rightfully stand out. If the Raptors go on to win this series, Lowry turning things around after just one bad game—this ranked eighth among his 46 playoff games in terms of Basketball-Reference's Game Score, while Game 1 was 40th—will have been a big part of that.</p><p>'It's just his competitive edge. He's one of those guys who is a competitor,' Casey said. 'Being with him over these years, I've seen him be in the trenches with him before. He's always bounced back. That's just who he is. He's a competitor. He's a fighter.'</p><p>That's not to say Lowry and the Raptors are in the clear yet. They only narrowly avoided being down 0-2, and the ball movement that helped free Lowry for a better, more aggressive night disappeared briefly in the third quarter when the Raptors seemed to get content with what proved a tenuous lead. They can be better, and the Bucks weren't thrilled with their defensive performance. As far as steps in the right direction go, though, this one was about as substantial as an Antetokounmpo stride in the open court.</p>","basketball, Kyle Lowry, nba, Toronto Raptors, NBA playoffs, nba playoffs 2017, DeMar DeRozan, Milwaukee Bucks"

5,2017-04-05,5903148F2DB5B9E50F1A46DF,VICE Sports,en_au,Explaining The Obscure Origins Of English Football’s Best Badges - VICE Sports,http://sports.vice.com/en_au/article/jp7dkx/explaining-the-obscure-origins-of-english-footballs-best-badges,"<p><i>This article originally appeared on VICE Sports UK.</i></p><p>When people talk about football as an art, they are generally referring to the game itself. The language of creative endeavour is often applied to a football match, whether we describe a goal as 'a masterpiece', a pass as 'picture perfect' or a moment of individual self-expression as a 'stroke of genius', as if the player involved were a master painter putting the final touches to some sublime work. Even in referring to football as 'the beautiful game', we acknowledge that it has some aesthetic significance above and beyond other sports; that it exists on a higher cultural plane where grace, style and visual elegance are paramount. Still, while a football match may be considered a form of artistic expression in a figurative sense, there is much de facto art in the game that has symbolic meaning which is often ignored.</p><p>While classic kit designs, stadium murals and <a href='https://sports.vice.com/en_uk/article/rating-statues-of-footballers-purely-on-artistic-merit'>commemorative statuary</a> are all obvious examples of artistry from the world of football, perhaps the most underappreciated art comes in the form of club badges and crests. Though many fans pay little real attention to the badge of an opposing team, there is much to be learnt about a side from the image emblazoned on their shirts. These images are emblematic of the way a football club understands its identity, whether in relation to sporting philosophy, the personality of the fans, history and heritage or links to its local area. Some badges even border on the allegorical, telling a story about the club which serves to illustrate some greater significance to its place in the game.</p><p>As well as illustrating how a club and its community perceive themselves, badges show how a club would like to be perceived. They are a form of communication and are intended to evoke an emotional response from opponents and outsiders. This is why, when identifying common themes in the insignia of English football, we most often come across martial, industrial and animal iconography, emblems which not only express a sense of identity but also serve as a warning to others. These are proud and intimidating motifs, designed to catch the eye of a club's adversaries and give them serious pause for thought.</p><p class='article__blockquote'><a href='https://sports.vice.com/en_uk/article/the-artistic-and-cultural-influence-of-arsenals-famous-back-four'></a><b><a href='https://sports.vice.com/en_uk/article/the-artistic-and-cultural-influence-of-arsenals-famous-back-four'>READ MORE: The Artistic and Cultural Influence of Arsenal's Famous Back Four</a></b></p><p>Among the best club badges in English football – this being a subjective judgement, of course – some of the most striking relate to industry. With so many football clubs originally formed as works teams or created to serve a town with some speciality in manufacturing, there are crests up and down the country which feature factories, chimneys, dockyards and mines. While these are fundamentally mundane in one sense, they are also suggestive of hard work, physical sacrifice and a no-nonsense, sleeves-rolled-up mentality, all of which are traditionally necessary to lump it in the English league system. Basically, not only are industrial motifs emblematic of a football club's working-class heritage, they also imply that the team and their fans are likely to be hard as nails.</p><p>So we come to one of the most eye catching badges in all of England, namely <a href='https://twitter.com/SUFCOfficial' target='_blank'>the fist and girder motif</a> of Scunthorpe United. While it may look like something dreamt up by a workers' council in Petrograd at the height of the Russian Revolution – and certainly appears to be stylistically influenced by Socialist Realism – it was in fact created by a local design student back in the nineties when the town council, whose coat of arms had been used as the previous badge, ended their sponsorship deal with the club. The girder of the current crest represents Scunthorpe's famous iron and steel industry, while the clenched fist represents unity and strength with all the aplomb of a historical trade union banner. The thunderous motion of the image, clenched fist punching upwards while gripping the giant steel beam tightly, is suggestive of an intense and brawny brand of football, which combined with the Iron's bold claret and blue colour scheme makes it an absolute belter of a badge.</p><p>Though it's hard to imagine a more working-class club crest than one featuring a sturdy industrial girder, Darlington 1883 of the National League North give Scunthorpe a run for their money. Their badge is, as far as we are aware, the only one in the world <a href='http://www.heartfootball.com/img/p/200283-35119-thickbox.jpg' target='_blank'>to feature both a big ol' Quaker hat and a steam locomotive</a>, this as a nod to the traditional influence of Quakerism in the town and the historical importance of the railway industry to its inhabitants. Set against a red and white background divided by a pronounced diagonal line, the badge gives mixed messages which are doubtlessly intended to confuse the opposition. On the one hand, there is the inherent peacefulness of the Quakers, and on the other, the terrifying power of the enormous steam train, hurtling towards us with all the implacable strength of the River Tees in full spate.</p><div class='article__media'><picture class='article__image'><source media='(max-width: 25em)' srcset='https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/04/05/explaining-the-obscure-origins-of-english-footballs-best-badges-body-image-1491384638.jpg?resize=400:*, https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/04/05/explaining-the-obscure-origins-of-english-footballs-best-badges-body-image-1491384638.jpg?resize=600:* 2x'><source media='(max-width: 40.625em)' srcset='https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/04/05/explaining-the-obscure-origins-of-english-footballs-best-badges-body-image-1491384638.jpg?resize=650:*, https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/04/05/explaining-the-obscure-origins-of-english-footballs-best-badges-body-image-1491384638.jpg?resize=975:* 2x'><source media='(max-width: 53.125em)' srcset='https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/04/05/explaining-the-obscure-origins-of-english-footballs-best-badges-body-image-1491384638.jpg?resize=850:*, https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/04/05/explaining-the-obscure-origins-of-english-footballs-best-badges-body-image-1491384638.jpg?resize=1275:* 2x'><source media='(max-width: 65.625em)' srcset='https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/04/05/explaining-the-obscure-origins-of-english-footballs-best-badges-body-image-1491384638.jpg?resize=1050:*, https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/04/05/explaining-the-obscure-origins-of-english-footballs-best-badges-body-image-1491384638.jpg?resize=1575:* 2x'><source media='(min-width: 65.625em)' srcset='https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/04/05/explaining-the-obscure-origins-of-english-footballs-best-badges-body-image-1491384638.jpg?resize=1050:*, https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/04/05/explaining-the-obscure-origins-of-english-footballs-best-badges-body-image-1491384638.jpg?resize=1575:* 2x'><img src='https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/04/05/explaining-the-obscure-origins-of-english-footballs-best-badges-body-image-1491384638.jpg' alt=''></picture><p class='article__image-caption'>PA Images</p></div><p>With a brief nod to <a href='https://twitter.com/bfc_official' target='_blank'>Barnsley's badge</a> which – while aesthetically uninspired and ripped off from the local council – features an actual miner, which has to be worth something in terms of working-class cachet, we now find ourselves looking at industrial badges which spill over thematically into something else. Just as the Darlington crest is a paean to both industry and religion, so <a href='https://twitter.com/ShrimpsOfficial' target='_blank'>the Morecambe badge</a> pays homage to both the local fishing industry and the animal kingdom, with the animal in question a massive marine crustacean with spindly head tendrils. The appropriately named Shrimps adopted their current club crest in 2010, celebrating their move from Christie Park to the Globe Arena with a rebranded logo in place of the town coat of arms. Though shrimps are not widely considered to be lethal animals – when potted, they are in fact a Morecambe Bay delicacy – they nonetheless have creepy little features which, when blown up to club crest proportions, could terrify even the hardiest of League Two footballers.</p><p>While Morecambe strike terror into the opposition by sporting an image of a gigantic shrimp, other clubs have gone with animals which are more traditionally associated with fear. So <a href='https://twitter.com/MillwallFC' target='_blank'>the undeniably brilliant Millwall badge</a> features a variant on the heraldic lion, with the creature leaping forward – claws extended – from the navy blue abyss. Though Millwall were originally a works side born of J.T. Morton's canning factory on the Isle of Dogs, they couldn't exactly go for a tin of non-perishables on their badge, and so had to seek out some other emblem. When they were dubbed the 'Lions of the South' after a strong run in the FA Cup at the turn of the twentieth century, it suited the team to appropriate the nickname. This in turn led to the lion logo being adopted in the thirties, when it was originally red as opposed to white on blue.</p><p>Though Millwall's leaping lion brings the terror factor – not least as it is now commonly associated with a less metaphorical form of violence from the heyday of English hooliganism – the comparatively serene and thoughtful lion on <a href='https://twitter.com/SalfordCityFC' target='_blank'>Salford City's badge</a> is similarly compelling. There were Salford fans who were not best pleased when the club's image underwent an overhaul under the ownership of the Class of '92, but with its hexagonal shape and interpretive design the new badge is, in fairness, considerably more distinctive than <a href='https://cdn.thenonleaguefootballpaper.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Salford-City-badge.jpg' target='_blank'>its predecessor</a>. While the origins of the Salford logo are ultramodern in this sense, it is not stylistically dissimilar to the wonderfully angular <a href='https://twitter.com/Wolves' target='_blank'>Wolverhampton Wanderers motif</a>, with that other deadly and menacing creature looking comparably thoughtful on the Wolves badge. That said, the Salford City lion looks as if it is pondering something philosophical – like the ethical implications of former Premier League footballers commandeering a local non-league side, say – while the Wolverhampton wolf appears to be thinking solely about devouring its prey with its merciless, menacing, triangular eyes.<br></p><div class='article__media'><picture class='article__image'><source media='(max-width: 25em)' srcset='https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/04/05/explaining-the-obscure-origins-of-english-footballs-best-badges-body-image-1491383171.jpg?resize=400:*, https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/04/05/explaining-the-obscure-origins-of-english-footballs-best-badges-body-image-1491383171.jpg?resize=600:* 2x'><source media='(max-width: 40.625em)' srcset='https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/04/05/explaining-the-obscure-origins-of-english-footballs-best-badges-body-image-1491383171.jpg?resize=650:*, https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/04/05/explaining-the-obscure-origins-of-english-footballs-best-badges-body-image-1491383171.jpg?resize=975:* 2x'><source media='(max-width: 53.125em)' srcset='https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/04/05/explaining-the-obscure-origins-of-english-footballs-best-badges-body-image-1491383171.jpg?resize=850:*, https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/04/05/explaining-the-obscure-origins-of-english-footballs-best-badges-body-image-1491383171.jpg?resize=1275:* 2x'><source media='(max-width: 65.625em)' srcset='https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/04/05/explaining-the-obscure-origins-of-english-footballs-best-badges-body-image-1491383171.jpg?resize=1050:*, https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/04/05/explaining-the-obscure-origins-of-english-footballs-best-badges-body-image-1491383171.jpg?resize=1575:* 2x'><source media='(min-width: 65.625em)' srcset='https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/04/05/explaining-the-obscure-origins-of-english-footballs-best-badges-body-image-1491383171.jpg?resize=1050:*, https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/04/05/explaining-the-obscure-origins-of-english-footballs-best-badges-body-image-1491383171.jpg?resize=1575:* 2x'><img src='https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/04/05/explaining-the-obscure-origins-of-english-footballs-best-badges-body-image-1491383171.jpg' alt=''></picture><p class='article__image-caption'>PA Images</p></div><p>The single wolf's head on the Wolves badge dates back to 1979, before which the crest featured three leaping wolves which were emblazoned on the centre of the club's home shirts. If the nominal Wolverhampton wolf is one of the most menacing creatures ever to appear on a football shirt, we ought also to identify the least menacing, which is surely the bewildered Herefordshire bull of <a href='https://twitter.com/HerefordFC' target='_blank'>the fantastic Hereford FC badge</a>, an animal which looks like it has wandered into a football club crest entirely by chance. For some clubs, one fearsome animal is not enough, <a href='https://twitter.com/PooleTownFC' target='_blank'>as is the case with Poole Town</a> who sport two monstrous dolphins on their aesthetically excellent badge. While some might contest the use of the term 'monstrous' here, Greek mythology would have it that dolphins are warped and mutated sailors condemned by Poseidon to live in the oceans, which seems pretty horrific really. Whether or not the designers of the Poole Town crest were aware of this is sadly unclear.<br></p><p>For those clubs for whom monstrous animals are not sufficiently intimidating, the last resort is an actual monster. That certainly seems to be the case with Coventry Sphinx, a club which competes in the Midland Premier Division and <a href='https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/75/Coventry_Sphinx_F.C.png' target='_blank'>sports the riddling Egyptian beast on their crest</a>. This ties back into the theme of industry in that the club were originally the works team of Armstrong Siddeley, a British motor company which used the sphinx as a logo and bonnet ornament on their cars. The Coventry Sphinx badge is possibly the most stylish in all the Midlands, though it is naturally run close by <a href='https://twitter.com/BCFC' target='_blank'>the globe, ribbon and ball of Birmingham City</a>, a crest which was chosen through a competition run by the <i>Sports Argus </i>newspaper in the early seventies, and which remains both instantly recognisable and remarkably elegant to this day.</p><p class='article__blockquote'><a href='https://sports.vice.com/en_uk/article/analysing-the-smoking-habits-of-footballers-and-iconic-managers'></a><b><a href='https://sports.vice.com/en_uk/article/analysing-the-smoking-habits-of-footballers-and-iconic-managers'>READ MORE: Analysing The Smoking Habits of Footballers and Iconic Managers</a></b></p><p>Perhaps the most common monster in football iconography is the wyvern, with a pair of the reptilian beasts adorning <a href='https://twitter.com/officialcufc' target='_blank'>the badges of Carlisle United</a> and <a href='https://twitter.com/leytonorientfc' target='_blank'>Leyton Orient</a>. In both cases these are symbolic of their locality, with wyverns taking pride of place on the crest of the City of London and representative of the region of Cumbria, too. It's hard not to make a wyvern eye catching, to be honest, what with its sinister serpentine body and vaguely satanic visage. It comes second in the devilish stakes only to the malevolent imp on <a href='https://twitter.com/LincolnCity_FC' target='_blank'>the Lincoln City badge</a>, which was introduced in 1971 in replacement of, that's right, the municipal coat of arms. The inspiration for the cross-legged demon comes from a grotesque statue on the wall of Lincoln Cathedral, hence providing us with an artwork from the world of football which is a direct imitation of pre-existing art.</p><p>Given its belligerent and aggressive connotations, martial imagery on club badges is perhaps the hardest to miss. Barring obvious badges like the famous Arsenal cannon – an emblem which traces its origins back to the Woolwich Arsenal and the munitions workers who gave the club its name – there is <a href='https://twitter.com/Blyth_Spartans' target='_blank'>the stylised Hellenic helmet of Blyth Spartans</a>, <a href='https://twitter.com/CAFCofficial' target='_blank'>the minimalist raised sword of Charlton Athletic</a> and <a href='https://twitter.com/Matlock_TownFC' target='_blank'>the heavily armoured gladiator of Matlock Town</a>, which together represent some of the best designed crests in the land. While the Spartan helmet should be self-explanatory and the Charlton sword dates back to the sixties, when the club adopted its 'Valiants' nickname, the emergence of the Matlock Town badge is rather more obscure. Indeed, the people of Matlock seems to have little by way of historical links to the Roman Empire, or indeed any particular reputation for making men kill each other in an amphitheatre for their sadistic entertainment.</p><p>And as for the most distinctive club badge in all of English football? This accolade must surely go to <a href='https://twitter.com/hemelfc' target='_blank'>Hemel Hempstead Town</a>, whose crest is an intricate red outline of infamous wife murderer (and town patron) Henry VIII. As a military man who was also a monster Henry represents something of a thematic mash up, as well as a reminder to opposition supporters that they are in the presence of ruthless footballing royalty, or whatever passes for such in the National League South. The inspiration for the Hemel motif is twofold, in that it draws on the famous portrait of Henry VIII as painted by Hans Holbein the Younger, which one might think would give it enormous artistic merit. Unfortunately, the club badge is actually an imitation of an imitation in the form of a Holbeinesque plaque with Henry VIII's face on it, long displayed on the front of a council building in Hemel town centre. Does that detract from its cultural significance a tad? Only the residents of Hemel can say.</p><p class='text-center'><b><a href='https://twitter.com/W_F_Magee' target='_blank'></a></b><i><b><a href='https://twitter.com/W_F_Magee' target='_blank'>@W_F_Magee</a></b></i><br></p>","darlington 1883, charlton athletic, Scunthorpe United, blythe spartans, english football, matlock town, coventry sphinx, Football, Barnsley, club badges, leyton orient, the symbolism of football motifs, WOLVES, hemel hempstead town, Millwall, birmingham city, club crests, morecambe, carlisle united, Lincoln City, salford city"

It's not the regular rock 'n' roll regime. You may have heard his stuff before, particularly if you're a fan of America's finest comedian, Doug Stanhope, who regularly uses Shubaly's broken-torch songs as the outro of his booze-fuelled podcast. Notable among them is <i><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3q8T_oHTus' target='_blank'>Don't Cut YR Hair</a></i> , which opens with: <i>'The potato peelings in the sink did not turn into vodka as I had hoped...'</i></p><p>The two remain cordial, despite an on-tour falling out some years ago. You know you've got a problem when Stanhope fires you for overdoing it, but sobering up took a little while longer. 'There was no new low that I hit in 2009 that made me quit,' he says. 'I'd drank in the mornings before, I'd drank at work before, I drank alone when I was a kid, I'd thrown up blood when I was still a teenager.'</p><p>In 2009 he was trying to stop drinking while night-managing a bar, which probably isn't the AA-approved method. Then one particular evening went south. A friend got sucker punched all the way to ER, and the night manager found himself back home in Brooklyn the next day, furious and lacking his bike, which was somewhere in Manhattan.</p><p>'So I walked outside and ran from Brooklyn into Manhattan to get it.

'But it's about balance,' she says. 'Being active, exercising, when that starts to take over your life and you stop doing other things as a result of it, then that becomes a problem in itself.'</p><p>Injury is a major issue when exercise becomes all consuming. Shubaly broke down in late 2010. 'I struggled that winter. As I had built an identity around alcohol, I had built an identity around running. There were certainly dark moments where I thought: 'If I can't run, I may as well drink.''</p><p>Thankfully, he'd travelled far enough down the new road to look at the real issue: that he needed 'a bigger life.' Writing and performing helped to build this, after all that running had smoothed the path. He still hits the streets, but has no truck with the 'addiction' theory.</p><p>'It's not a replacement addiction, it's the opposite of addiction for me, and I'd caution anyone from leaping to that 'you've just replaced one addiction with another' assumption. Yes, it's healthy. Yes, I do it habitually. Yes, it brings me happiness, in a roundabout way. So does breathing, so does eating, so does sleeping, but you would never describe someone as a breathing addict or a life addict. Exercise is good for you. Everyone should do it. It's one of the ways to embrace the challenges that life has for us instead of avoiding them.'</p><p class='article__blockquote'><b><a href='https://sports.vice.com/en_uk/article/overcoming-the-empathy-barrier-mental-health-in-the-premier-league'>READ MORE: Overcoming the Empathy Barrier – Mental Health in the Premier League</a></b><br></p><p>Unless, of course, you actively use exercise to avoid those challenges. One common theme is apparent among these differing athletes: it's about working stuff out. For Shubaly, those lonely hours help him to think – 'I got over a nine-month relationship in one 50-mile run,' he says – while for Jarvis, it's social. The ambassador programme she helped launch, labelled <i>#runandtalk</i>, encourages people to do just that, because shared activities knock down social barriers. 'You can see it in the running community,' she says, 'people are far more open to say that they're dealing with stress or not feeling great.'</p><p>Gadd has a more complex relationship with running, but eventually it helped him sort stuff out too, via his show. The on-off year-long run of it 'has been incredibly cathartic, more than I ever anticipated,' he admits.</p><p>'I used to think that one day I might have the courage to speak on a stage about what happened. It was in my head for years. Maybe I could pound a treadmill and get a point across to the audience about how fucked a situation it all was? I always felt it would have a powerful effect. Turns out I was right.'</p><p>They're still pounding away. Gadd is off to perform his show in Melbourne for a month, then Edinburgh again, and the on-stage distance is racking up. 'Definitely over a thousand kilometres so far, without question,' he says. 'It's why I now walk like a pigeon with dyspraxia.'</p><p>And Shubaly? He recently ran a marathon on his 40th birthday, just to keep his hand in, but 'in the ultra community, what I run isn't impressive,' he says. 'I have friends who are running 135-mile winter races, 150 mile races... I just don't feel the burning need for it as I once did.</p><p>'I learned so much about running, about myself, about survival, about getting better, about life itself. Running taught me that sometimes the hardest way is also the best way.

And we eat it up, convincing ourselves that not allowing campus players to get paid anything beyond full grant-in-aid produces something purer and ultimately better than anything those money-grubbing professionals can offer.</p><p>March Madness is the epitome of this. We don't like to think about big-time college basketball as a billion-dollar industry, one that saddles the athletes we love rooting for with absurd financial restrictions, intense demands, and a lack of basic rights. And the people on the right side of those billions of dollars, particularly in NCAA executive suites, are more than happy to profit from our sentimentality.</p><p>Well, as a former Division I basketball player myself, let me offer a corrective: from an athlete's perspective, amateurism is both burdensome and totally irrelevant.</p><p class='article__blockquote'><a href='https://sports.vice.com/en_us/article/what-i-paid-to-be-a-division-i-athlete'><b>Read More: What I Paid To Be A Division I Athlete</b></a></p><p>First of all, having money in your pocket—and more importantly, having a say about the rules that dominate your entire life, from what you can eat to whom you can speak with—does not impact one's love for the game. To the contrary, and from my experience, it's being broke, fighting through grueling off-season conditioning, working on holidays, and getting verbally attacked throughout double sessions that actually drives many college basketball players to hate the game.</p><p>Moreover, being able to make money doesn't run counter to learning. Do you know anyone who would have gotten better grades if they had just been more hard up for cash? If anything, increased income for athletes could be a valuable part of their educational experiences—for example, it's hard to learn about finance and money management when you're strapped—and would serve as a major help for a lot of families struggling to make ends meet.</p><p>Besides, amateurism itself is a facade. It doesn't really exist. The NCAA moves heaven and Earth to punish those who dare violate amateurism sanctity, all while defining what the term means. As it turns out, their definition is highly malleable.

It's a natural desire shared by athletes, coaches, fans and sponsors alike, and there are many ways improvement can be sought, from the light areas of professionalism to the dark arts of doping.<br></p><p>But there is another way: a shady middle ground where advances are equally likely to be met by applause as by accusations of cheating. Technological innovation in sport occupies this ambiguous position.</p><p>Once so in vogue, the term 'marginal gains' may have taken a near-fatal knock in the wake of <a href='https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/mar/05/team-sky-sir-dave-brailsford' target='_blank'>Sir Dave Brailsford and Team Sky's prolonged and wince-inducing fall from grace</a>. Nevertheless, the idea of finding small advantages and collating them to generate an edge remains a universal concept across professional sport.</p><p>But with everyone chasing the same thing, what is the difference between acceptable and unacceptable technological advances? Where should the line be drawn? The answer for many sports lies in their rulebooks, which are written in language that is sufficiently vague as to be interpreted to fit a variety of agendas.</p><p>Governing bodies wish to keep their sports stable – moving forward, but not <i>too</i> quickly. As such, significant leaps can lead to a period of flux: new world records, lop-sided contests, and previously unfathomable feats reached.</p><p>Manufacturers, sponsors, athletes and fans are diametrically opposed to this for various reasons. For instance, big technological leaps can provide prestige, exposure, glory, and spectacle.</p><p>This is the cutting edge of elite sport: it's high steaks and big business.</p><p class='article__blockquote'><b><a href='https://sports.vice.com/en_uk/article/the-cybathlon-where-paraplegics-walk-again'>READ MORE: The Cybathlon – Where Paraplegics Compete Again</a></b><br></p><p>It is in this context that Nike – not for the first time – has found itself entangled in controversy. The sports giant has embarked upon an ambitious project to bring the marathon world record time below the two-hour mark. <a href='http://www.sub2hrs.com/' target='_blank'>Breaking2</a> aims to achieve this using cutting-edge sports science, nutrition, perfect conditions and, crucially, new trainers. They hope that this will propel three of the world's best marathon runners – Kenya's Eliud Kipchoge, Ethiopian Lelisa Desisa and Zersenay Tadese of Eritrea – around Italian Formula 1 track Monza at an unprecedented speed, on a yet-to-be-confirmed date.</p><p>To achieve their goal Nike will need to cut almost three minutes off the current 2:02.57 world record time, set by Kenya's Dennis Kimetto at the 2014 Berlin Marathon. Their not-so-secret weapon is the Zoom Vaporfly Elite, a lightweight shoe fitted with a carbon fibre spring-like device in the midsole, which is designed to return energy better than the conventional foam style.</p><p>Given that it took almost 20 years to drop the last three minutes from the record time, Nike have taken on quite a challenge. It's fair, then, to ask if they really believe their own hype: that running 26.2 miles in under 120 minutes is 'no longer a matter of if, but rather when.'</p><p>'It's a marketing ploy more than anything,' Steve Magness, author of <i>The Science of Running</i>, told VICE Sports. 'Shoe companies don't want to wait. They want the marketing exposure of going after a big goal. They know that getting there first is all that matters. It's not about the sport or the athletes, it's about the company selling products. It's sad.'</p><p>Much like the similarly named <a href='http://www.sub2hrs.com/' target='_blank'>Sub-2 project</a>, Nike's overall goal itself may well be driven by vanity. But according to Ross Tucker, who writes the influential <i>The Science of Sport </i>blog, the Vaporfly <a href='http://sportsscientists.com/2016/12/sub-2-hour-marathon-2017-thoughts-concept/' target='_blank'>could just</a> make it possible. Nike's independent tester Rodger Kram found that the carbon fibre plate returned four per cent of the energy expended, reducing the amount of oxygen needed to run at a fast pace – theoretically enough to shave off three minutes.</p><p>This is where the controversy – and the question of innovation versus cheating – comes in. Ed Caesar, author of <i>Two Hours:</i> <i>The Quest to Run the Impossible Marathon</i>, <a href='https://www.wired.com/2017/03/nikes-controversial-new-shoes-made-run-faster' target='_blank'>said</a> he felt as though he was running downhill when he took Nike's pride and joy for a spin. Should this sensation be allowed? The answer for many of those in the know is that it should not.</p><p>'I'm all for innovation, but it has to be within reason,' says Magness, a former member of Nike's controversial Oregon Project. 'If the Nike shoe gives as much of an improvement as they claim, then it should be banned.

While the likes of Mo Farah, Kenenisa Bekele and Galen Rupp are already benefiting from the technology, the Zoom Vaporfly will also affect the amateur sphere when go they go on sale in the U.S. in June for $250. But with more profits on the horizon, the company don't seem too concerned by the negative attention. 'To me it's kind of a compliment when you are delivering a big enough benefit that people are starting to ask: 'is this unfair?'' Nike's senior director of global running footwear Bret Schoolmeester <a href='https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/08/sports/nikes-vivid-shoes-and-the-gray-area-of-performance-enhancement.html' target='_blank'>said</a> recently.</p><p>'Running is behind the times,' said Magness, who coaches Olympic athletes. 'Our rule is so vague that almost anything could be banned or allowed.' And there's the crux of the problem. The IAAF's rules state that shoes must not offer 'any unfair additional assistance, including by the incorporation of any technology which will give the wearer any unfair advantage.' But how do you define unfair? Since Oscar Pistorius' case reached the Court of Arbitration for Sport in 2008, it is up to the athlete to prove their equipment gives no advantage, not the other way around. That said, the IAAF confirmed last month that they are investigating the latest innovations – which, they say, are not limited to Nike's.</p><p>Ultimately it might just take new a marathon record, powered by carbon fibre spring technology, for the world to sit up and take notice. Magness believes that too large of an improvement could make 'a mockery of the sport.' If records start to tumble the rulebook may be forced to tidy up its ambiguous language.</p><p>There is certainly precedent for this. Magness points to swimming and the banning of full-body non-textile polyurethane swimsuits in 2010. Their introduction turned the sport upside down, with pockets of gas adding buoyancy, reducing drag, and helping propulsion. The result was certainly noticeable: 29 world records were set inside the first five days of the 2009 Fina World Championships. Such drastic results and the testimony of athletes – German swimmer Britta Steffen said she felt like a 'speedboat' in the water – led to a ban, with asterisks placed alongside all records that were set wearing them.</p><p>That case was fairly clear-cut, but there are plenty of examples across sport that are less easy to categorise. In cycling, <a href='https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=graham+obree+superman&espv=2&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiH0uTwmrPTAhXSYVAKHXquDZkQ_AUIBigB&biw=1109&bih=637#imgrc=BlXEYSIe2ow7pM:' target='_blank'>Graeme Obree's 'Superman' riding position</a> stalled after the UCI banned extended handlebars in 1996, while tennis' 'spaghetti-stringed' rackets were outlawed in 1978. More recently, golf's 'belly-putting' technique was stopped after Keegan Bradley, Ernie Els, Webb Simpson and Adam Scott, among others, won majors using the anchored style.</p><p class='article__blockquote'><a href='https://sports.vice.com/en_uk/article/is-our-obsession-with-technology-damaging-the-match-going-experience'></a><b><a href='https://sports.vice.com/en_uk/article/is-our-obsession-with-technology-damaging-the-match-going-experience'>READ MORE: Is Our Obsession With Technology Damaging Football's Match-Going Experience?</a></b></p><p>But the case is more nuanced elsewhere. Carbon fibre sheets on the back of cricket bats may have been outlawed in 2008, but some within the game are still worried, with more and more sixes being hit. The Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) believe oversized bats are to blame and have acted: from October, the maximum dimensions of a bat will be set to 108mm in width, 67mm in depth, with 40mm edges.</p><p>Announcing the change, MCC's head of cricket, John Stephenson<i>,</i> talked about redressing 'the balance between bat and ball' – a phrase frequently rolled out by the game's arbiters and administrators. But Chris King, bat-maker for <a href='http://www.gray-nicolls.co.uk/eng' target='_blank'>Gray-Nicolls</a>, knows it is the weight and batsman's hand-speed, not the dimensions, that really matter. After all, power-hitter David Warner uses the same 2lb 10z bat as the circumspect Alastair Cook. That fact hasn't stopped innovation being curtailed; the recurring sight of the ball flying out of the stadium is a powerful one to traditionalists.</p><p>'There is now no room for innovation,' King told VICE Sports. 'Any innovation in bats is purely in their shape, and at this point in cricket's history pretty much everything in that department has been tried. Bats are almost totemic: they illicit strong nostalgic feelings in players, and the MCC's law echoes that in its need for the bat to fit into some historic idea that it doesn't create an unfair advantage.'</p><p>King believes that while performance-based technological advances for bats are a thing of the past, the new regulations will do some good. 'I welcome the restriction because it will stop endless requests for a light bat that's as big as possible,' he said. 'Hopefully the focus will come back to how good a bat is, because of how well it's made.'</p><p>Ultimately, the validity of technological innovations are decided upon by each sport's governing body. Due to the vagaries of the terminology, they tend to be judged subjectively. In time, and with some highly publicised success behind it, a piece of carbon fibre in a running shoe, just like many of its controversial predecessors, may well be deemed unfair. Until that eventuality, Nike will continue to trumpet their newest product.</p><p>Finding the right balance is clearly difficult. But, just as its competitors continue striving to be better, it is important that each sport tries to do so. After all, as Magness puts it: 'We don't want the winner decided by who has the best baseball bat, swimsuit, or tennis racket.'</p><p class='text-center'><a href='https://twitter.com/felixkeith' target='_blank'><b><i>@felixkeith</i></b></a></p>","Dennis Kimetto, breaking2, nike, eliud kipchoge, steve magness, chris king, nike zoom vaporfly, zersenay tadese, gray-nicolls, train hard and buy the right trainers, technology in sport, lelisa desisa, marginal gains"

However, at 15 years old – when life is reduced to a series of concerns relating solely to your football team, Three6Mafia mixtapes and an inability to chirpse girls properly – a joyless 2-1 home defeat to Wycombe Wanderers is capable of delivering trauma to both heart and head.</p><p>At the end of the 2000-01 season, my beloved Bristol Rovers needed to beat Wycombe to maintain any hope of Second Division survival. My memories of the game are admittedly patchy. The first half was eventless and definitely goalless. I remember a very young Nathan Ellington, and very old Mark Walters, both hitting the woodwork – this before Wycombe scored two quick goals midway through the second half. We got a goal back (which I remember) apparently through Kevin Gall (who I most certainly do not) to make it 2-1. But it was all in vain. Vitali Astafjevs, our future Latvia captain, was scythed down for a criminally unawarded penalty in the 90th minute, and we were unceremoniously relegated to the bottom tier of the Football League.</p><p>At the final whistle hundreds of people piled onto the pitch to vent their anger at the board and swear their heads off. Teenagers cried. Angry fat men bellowed their discontent at the efforts of reasonably well conditioned athletes. Some people were just utterly distraught – each of them wandering around aimlessly, wearing the bewildered expression of someone who'd just found out their favourite uncle had been picked up by Yewtree. Me and my mates Westy, Al, Dan and Will just kinda hung around on the terrace, muted and probably a bit embarrassed that we cared so much, before facing up to the prospect of going into school on Monday and being confronted by a braying bunch of Shitheads (our term for Bristol City fans). One hope was that we might actually win something the following season, though we were only promoted via the play-offs six years later. It felt really fucking bleak. But it benchmarked something.</p><p>In my lifetime, Rovers have never won anything beyond the odd play-off final and derby. But success is also relative. It's the poverty of silverware, and the genuine sense of loss I felt after that Wycombe match, that make moments like some of those we've had this season feel like paradise.</p><p>It's those periods between desire and gratification – via any number of bruises, flirtations, disappointments and mediocrities – that make supporting a genuinely shit football team a unique form of torture. Any successes, however minor or fleeting, always feel like rare moments of affection in the midst of an unhappy marriage. In football, as in life, you always lack more than you have – and that's kind of beautiful, in its own way.</p><h3>ANTH STOCKDALE – 'OFFICE DJ'</h3><p>As a Sunderland fan, it has to be going to Chelsea away – full stop.</p><p>Having heat lamps on the roof and having to take my jacket off during a winter fixture is the sort of modern football bullshit that would make my coalmining grandfather turn in his grave. Also, having nothing but bottles of Tiger beer and some kind of 'waffle-fries' shit on the menu at half time was an insult to the beautiful game.</p><p>Never again.</p><h3>JON KEARNS – ADVERTISING/MARRIAGE EXPERT</h3><p>Just six months into my own wonderful marriage, and my beautiful American wife had the forethought to get us tickets and a weekend away to see Liverpool play West Ham at Anfield. It was January 2015 and just around peak optimism time for Liverpool fans in the post-Suarez, pre-Klopp era. The team had navigated the tricky Christmas period with four wins in five, and Sturridge was back from injury (this at a time when many Liverpool fans still had vain hopes he could develop into Suarez 2.0). I was a little disappointed not to see Gerrard play and it was a freezing cold January afternoon, but watching Liverpool win 2-0 – with goals from Sturridge and Sterling – was all I could ask for really, and it was all thanks to my dearly beloved huddled next to me in the northern English chill.</p><p>It wasn't until we were on the bus back to town after the game that I suddenly looked at her and made a face of such utter dismay that she still teases me about it two years on. In the freezing cold – and despite wearing gloves – I had managed to lose my wedding ring. I was devastated and, after scrabbling around coat pockets and bus floors, I quickly realised it must have been at half-time, when I took my gloves from my cold-shrivelled hands to pay for the tea and hot chocolate. I wanted to leap off the bus and run back to the ground to search for the ring, so frantic was my sense of panic. In my newlywed naivety<b>, </b>and still sounding out our transatlantic cultural differences (the wedding was a <i>big</i> deal), I had no idea how upset she was going to be. To my mind, this was an almost marriage-ending disaster. How had I managed to lose it without noticing? She'd gone and arranged all this for me – you'd think the least I could do was pay basic care and attention to the symbol of our undying love.</p><p>As it turned out, she was remarkably chill about the loss. She concluded, to the slight bruising of my supposed bread-winner ego: 'At least it wasn't that expensive a ring to lose.' Finally she determined, with the sort of pragmatism that made me marry her in the first place: 'Well if you were going to leave me for anyone, I'd rather it be for Anfield than another woman.'</p><div class='article__media'><picture class='article__image'><source media='(max-width: 25em)' srcset='https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/04/05/vice-writers-on-their-worst-ever-experiences-at-the-football-body-image-1491396015.jpg?resize=400:*, https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/04/05/vice-writers-on-their-worst-ever-experiences-at-the-football-body-image-1491396015.jpg?resize=600:* 2x'><source media='(max-width: 40.625em)' srcset='https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/04/05/vice-writers-on-their-worst-ever-experiences-at-the-football-body-image-1491396015.jpg?resize=650:*, https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/04/05/vice-writers-on-their-worst-ever-experiences-at-the-football-body-image-1491396015.jpg?resize=975:* 2x'><source media='(max-width: 53.125em)' srcset='https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/04/05/vice-writers-on-their-worst-ever-experiences-at-the-football-body-image-1491396015.jpg?resize=850:*, https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/04/05/vice-writers-on-their-worst-ever-experiences-at-the-football-body-image-1491396015.jpg?resize=1275:* 2x'><source media='(max-width: 65.625em)' srcset='https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/04/05/vice-writers-on-their-worst-ever-experiences-at-the-football-body-image-1491396015.jpg?resize=1050:*, https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/04/05/vice-writers-on-their-worst-ever-experiences-at-the-football-body-image-1491396015.jpg?resize=1575:* 2x'><source media='(min-width: 65.625em)' srcset='https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/04/05/vice-writers-on-their-worst-ever-experiences-at-the-football-body-image-1491396015.jpg?resize=1050:*, https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/04/05/vice-writers-on-their-worst-ever-experiences-at-the-football-body-image-1491396015.jpg?resize=1575:* 2x'><img src='https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/04/05/vice-writers-on-their-worst-ever-experiences-at-the-football-body-image-1491396015.jpg' alt=''></picture><p class='article__image-caption'>PA Images</p></div><h3><b>WILL MAGEE – VICE SPORTS UK STAFF WRITER</b><br></h3><p>They are a strange breed, are they not, away fans? They are a tribal bunch, a collective throwback to a time when human societies were organised on a much smaller level. They gather together in their little groups on the morning of matchday, each carpool a little band of hunter gatherers, a clan of cavemen ready to go to battle with some rival tribe across the windblown steppe. There they are, the away boys, armed not with the handcrafted spears of prehistory but rather with chants, with tins, with the boisterous aura of several grown men who are willing to fight and die for each other – or at least say so repeatedly – on the way to Carlisle, or Grimsby, or whichever post-industrial town happens to be hosting this weekend's game.</p><p>There is something atavistic about committed away fans, something primeval. These are men – for they almost invariably are men – who can turn a train carriage into a territorial wrangle, them against the common commuters and innocent non-footballing bystanders of the world. These are men who will belt out lewd songs mere metres away from a family of four, the children shrinking embarrassedly into their window seats, the dad turning an incandescent shade of scarlet, visibly getting angrier and angrier but realising that he, the lone alpha, is hopelessly outnumbered. There is something terrible about away fans, with their chest-beating masculinity and their strength-in-numbers bravado, exuding a fug of testosterone and antagonism as they hurtle towards their destination. Nonetheless, sneakingly, we want to go amongst them. Much like some eccentric primatologist who lives amongst mountain gorillas for months on end, a part of us wants to cultivate their acceptance so that we may see through their eyes, gradually follow their lead in shedding our own civilised pretensions and, eventually, learn to imitate their wild and exhilarating ways.</p><p>Still, much like the existence of a gorilla or prehistoric caveman, the life of an away fan can be brutal and unforgiving. While the away fan has a primal sense of camaraderie to keep him warm at night, he must brave many a frosty terrace and shite performance on the road in return. It was in the icy winter of 2012 when I learnt this for myself, in what would be my first and last long-distance journey to support the football club of my youth. That journey saw me rock up in the heart of Bradford, ready to watch Arsenal notch up a routine League Cup win at Valley Parade.</p><p>Accompanied by a friend who was making the near 600 mile round trip from Exeter – please bear his costly personal odyssey in mind come the conclusion of this anecdote – the life of an away fan showed promising beginnings. There were cans, there were chants and there was the warm embrace of an away pub, another aspect of the away days phenomenon which makes the whole thing feel like a primitive territorial feud. It was cruelly, bitterly, achingly cold, with the sharp Bradfordian air slicing through jackets, bobble hats and human bone, each gust of wind like a shard of glass through our flesh. Still, it would all be worth it, with the discomfort no doubt fading in the memory once our North London tribe had won the day.</p><p>Of course, Arsenal did not record a routine win against fourth-division Bradford City. Instead, they crashed out of the League Cup with possibly their easiest ever run to the final, this at a time when the club had gone without silverware for almost a decade. Not only that, it was one of the worst performances of all time and included <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjWphnVEQjc' target='_blank'>this spectacular miss</a> from the man, the legend, Gervinho, of which we had a fantastic view. To top it all off, Arsenal managed to take it to penalties before losing, hence causing frostbite amongst many of the huddled nomads in the away end.</p><p>It was at that moment that, looking at the faces around me, I came to the realisation that I did not have it in me to live amongst the away fans. I did not have the fortitude to survive alongside these cold and thwarted hunter gatherers, these hardiest and most heartbroken of men.</p><h3>AARON GORDON – VICE SPORTS US STAFF WRITER<br></h3><p>The worst soccer experience I ever had was a 2013 MLS game between the Vancouver Whitecaps and the Seattle Sounders. The game was perfectly fine, to be honest. The bad part was the person in front of me had the worst body odour I have ever experienced in my entire life. I almost threw up it was so rancid, but there was nothing I could do about it. I just had to stand there and take it for two hours. Please don't make me think about it any longer.

First football match: slow slumping 1-3 home loss at Chesterfield, 1997, don't even remember the opposition but when the announcer struggled with the vaguely foreign name of an away team substitute someone in the crowd shouted 'Who?' to a cacophony of that grim sort of football stand laughter, the bad laughter, the dark laughter, the one that I – a particularly wimpy 10-year-old, even for a 10-year-old – cowered to hear.</p><p>Subsequent football matches: another drizzle-strewn 1-1 at Saltergate; a handful of England games at Wembley, ones I'm pretty sure I only ended up at because of some sort of ticket scam (a friend of mine from back home used to get these England tickets face-value from 'a guy at work', who used to go – religiously – to England away days. 'It's a jolly, in't it!' he would say, the guy at work, 'it's good! See European countries. 40p, a pint, in Macedonia,' but then curiously he would go to literally zero home games, and we puzzled over it for a while, why he would buy the tickets but not go, or sell us the tickets at face value, Do You Not Want To Go Yourself, we would ask him, Are You Sure, and then walking up Wembley Way once we figured it out at the bag searches: of course, of course, our guy was banned from Wembley for violence, and only went to away games so he could cave in the heads of new, extravagant and continental skulls, of course he was, of course); the FA Cup youth final between Arsenal and Liverpool, where Jack Wilshere was making his name, but me, in my infinite wisdom, walked away from the match talking up the quality of Francis Coquelin (???????) and Kyle Bartley (??????), Such Good Movement, I would say, Bartley Will Be At The Heart of The Arsenal Defence For Years to Come, Proper Ball Playing Centre Back, him.</p><p>Maybe I don't appreciate live football because I'm an idiot who knows nothing about the sport, admittedly, but I think there's something more: I just don't understand the buzz of it, the up-on-your-feet of it. I get self-conscious shouting along with chants I don't know the words to, saying 'go ON!' in that performative way, more for the hard lad behind me in the stands than for the winger it was intended for. I don't think I've ever seen a live goal – apart from Yaya Sanogo's two-minute heartstopper against Borussia Dortmund, 2014 – that made me think anything other than 'eh' and 'I need to stand up now'. I recently went to an Arsenal game – Arsenal, slumping awfully at home to Southampton, a truly atrocious League Cup game – and didn't manage to make it to my seat until the 35th minute, because the checks and queues at the gate I was going in through were so extreme.</p><p>Every time I've been to a game in modern times, all the fun has been stripped out of it – the bag searches, the pat downs, the frantic queue for an £8 hotdog and a £6 beer in a plastic cup, then you run back out to the stands, leaving the spirit of fun behind you in the foyer – sort of like going to the cinema, if the cinema smelt of grass and you felt nothing as the images on the screen flitted by. Listen, I'm like you: I don't want anyone ripping a plastic chair out of some concrete and battering my head in with it. But I do want to feel alive a little. Watching football in the pub: a joy. Watching at home with some cans, crisps and mates: one of my favourite things to do in the entire world. Going to an actual game, trudging in and then out, watching from a weird angle, the walk back to the station with all the grim mutterings of loss, or the quiet that'll-do joy of a routine win? Eh, it's not for me. I'm glad you like it – truly, I am.

Imagine that you've elected Trump president, or you've just eaten a few hundred milligrams of THC and you're face-deep in pinot noir and you've projectile vomited into a bucket. Wiping chunks from the edges of your mouth, a vision of the future sharpens between the hazy edges of your scrambled brain, and it looks like this: President Donald J. Trump, flanked by Don King and Mike Tyson, sitting ringside at Madison Square Garden, watching Floyd Mayweather, Jr., and UFC champion Conor McGregor go a dozen rounds in eight-ounce gloves.</p><p>The jowls and clenched-sphincter lips. The face tattoo. The hair magnetized to the sky. The boxing superfight that is large as well as pointless. This is a fiction, but it's a fiction so effortless to imagine because of how seamlessly it can become fact. And before nuclear weapons reduce us to radioactive dust on purpose or <a href='http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/world-war-three-by-mistake' target='_blank'>by accident</a>, it will happen.</p><p>A portion of this vision is already part of the record. Mike and the two Dons were frequently <a href='http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/missoulian.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/5/ac/5ac7ee0d-722f-5b1b-9e73-262b8eaf84cc/573cc7391c527.image.jpg' target='_blank'>photographed together</a> in the 1980s, back when their worlds first started overlapping. Trump pushed to turn Atlantic City into the nation's new boxing capital, and he made millions of dollars from hosting four prime-era Tyson fights near Trump Plaza. Shortly after Tyson beat Michael Spinks in 1988, he became Tyson's business adviser and Trump remained an outspoken apologist, blaming the 18-year-old victim for Tyson's rape charge and advocating replacing his jail sentence with a fine. (More strangely, <a href='http://theconcourse.deadspin.com/here-s-a-weird-fucking-story-about-donald-trump-and-mik-1787459212' target='_blank'>Trump says Tyson once asked him if he was having an affair with his wife, then immediately fell asleep on his couch</a>.) King, a promoter with a violent and checkered history, came along in 1988 and put his hand in Tyson's pocket, just like he did Muhammad Ali and Larry Holmes.</p><p>Then the 1990s came along and broke apart this three-headed superorganism of 1980s celebrities. Tyson and King had a public falling out, with Tyson suing King for $100 million that he allegedly stole from him. A Senate subcommittee investigated King for his alleged ties to organized crime. And Trump, an inductee in the New Jersey Boxing Hall of Fame, made a bold exit from bringing big fights to Atlantic City: as his casinos started to collapse, he hosted the 1991 heavyweight championship bout between Evander Holyfield and George Foreman, then invoked the contract's act of war clause—remember: the Persian Gulf War took place nowhere near New Jersey—to squirm out of paying $2.5 <a href='http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/boxing/bob-arum--how-donald-trump--swindled---2-5-million-from-me-232036713.html' target='_blank'>million</a>. The billion-dollar Trump Taj Mahal declared bankruptcy three months later. Today it's gone.</p><p>A few decades makes a difference. Tyson rehabilitated his public image as an ear-biting brute. In September, Don King, still scraping by in the boxing world, nearly had the street where he stomped a man to death half a century ago named after him. Trump, who claimed a $916 million loss on his 1995 tax return, won a presidential election based on his alleged business acumen and other things that are depressing to think about. And while Tyson and King remain at odds—Tyson once <a href='https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/nov/14/mike-tyson-undisputed-truth-astonishing-claims' target='_blank'>recalled</a> a car ride while he was ostensibly trying to patch things up with King: 'Don said some innocuous thing and all that jealousy and rage spilled out of me and I kicked him in his fucking head'—Trump is their common ground. Both Tyson and King were enthusiastic, <a href='http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/21/politics/don-king-politics-donald-trump/' target='_blank'>vocal Trump supporters</a> in the lead up to the 2016 election.</p><p>Animosity is forgettable, especially when the walls of logic close in and especially in the pursuit of millions. Two years after Trump <a href='https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/462823141786812416?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw' target='_blank'>called</a> Mayweather's decision win over Marcos Maidana a 'disgrace,' Mayweather <a href='https://twitter.com/DonaldJTrumpJr/status/799067083250212864?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw' target='_blank'>posed</a> with Trump and his 80s ski-movie-villain son at Trump Tower. McGregor, who once said 'Donald can shut his big fat mouth, I don't give a fuck about Donald Trump,' <a href='http://edition.cnn.com/2016/11/11/sport/conor-mcgregor-president-trump-ufc/' target='_blank'>told</a> CNN days after the election: 'Maybe Donald won't be so bad in there.'</p><p>So let's keep beating the dead horse of a boxing match where McGregor fights Mayweather. It would be combat sports spectacle at its most empty because the fight poses a question that no one really wants answered: How would an MMA fighter do when you take away everything but his fists and put him upright in front of the best boxer in recent history? (Terribly. It wouldn't even be close.) It would require raiding Scrooge McDuck's Money Bin to pay Mayweather's purse and McGregor doing some legal and business gymnastics to wriggle out of the constraints of his UFC contract, all for the pleasure of having Mayweather jab him into a puffy-faced mess. Yet it's a fight that McGregor and Mayweather both want because of how fat their pockets would be at the end of it, and the apparent similarities between boxing and MMA—both glove-to-face hitting sports with rounds and whatever—make it feel remotely competitive even when it isn't. It's a novelty that boils down to 140 characters or less.</p><p>And what better mouthpiece to hire for a squash match with the packaging of importance than Trump, the ultimate in shameless carnival barkers? Trump would welcome any chance to be in proximity to tough guys, and an association with McGregor-Mayweather would be grand enough to clear the bad memories of Holyfield-Foreman. In a few days, Trump will have the executive branch at his disposal to pull together an empty-calorie match-up under the bright lights of Madison Square Garden, because <a href='http://www.businessinsider.com/atlantic-city-is-a-ghost-town-2016-1' target='_blank'>Atlantic City is a ghost town</a>. He'll also have a soapbox in the Oval Office where he can tell an army of true believers who butt-chug his every lie and misdirection—while his Cabinet grows more cannibalistic and racist and adds billions to its net worth—about how great a fight between a 49-0 veteran and a 0-0 novice will be. And as long as you're asking them to pay for a border wall with the hollow promise of Mexico reimbursing the cost, just finance McGregor-Mayweather with taxpayer dollars too. Use the Department of Energy's budget to pay up front, and take a few pay-per-views points and a couple of ringside seats for you and your two friends who probably still hate each other.</p><p>This is the essential vision of America circa 2017, where nothing makes sense, amnesia and money heals old wounds, and a gladiatorial cash grab distracts from the cliff we're about to go over. This will be the biggest fight of all time. It will break records. Believe me.</p>","Fightland, 2017, Mike Tyson, floyd mayweather, Conor McGregor, Donald Trump, boxing"

They have managed to tread water the last few years as their veteran core slowly fell away. Now the Yanks are buoyed by one of the best farm systems in baseball, though the consensus is that they are still a year or two away from serious contention. The 2017 club has a parade of question marks in the starting rotation behind ace Masahiro Tanaka, and the lineup is largely unproven.</p><p>But forget about all that for a moment. The prognosticators might not know what kind of record the Yankees will put up this season, but you can be damn well sure of one thing: they are going to hit the ever-loving shit out of some baseballs. I'm not talking about hits, runs scored, or even slugging percentage; I mean they are going to hit baseballs <i>hard. </i>That highly regarded farm system might not be ready to produce a playoff team, but they have already blessed the Bronx with some seriously large dudes who sock awe-inspiring dingers—the kind of moon shots that make the viewer put down his or her 'Why Don't Lazy Millennial Idiots Watch Baseball?' thinkpieces and just appreciate the magnificent violence taking place between bat and ball.</p><p>Aaron Judge, Gary Sanchez, and Greg Bird each have a great deal to prove this year; it will be the first time each player has started the season with the big club. But science has already determined, via the exit velocity statistic, that all three men have elite baseball-abusing ability. Now that they have finished demolishing the Grapefruit League, let's examine each young Bomber's prospects for hitting some baseballs hard in the regular season.</p><p><b>Aaron Judge</b></p><p><i>2016 average exit velocity: 95.5 MPH (2nd in MLB)</i></p><p>This kid leaves one hell of a first impression.

15,2017-02-09,5903148ECD788BE5BE75A44D,VICE Sports,en_au,The Sports Teams Who Defied The Apartheid Boycott of South Africa - VICE Sports,http://sports.vice.com/en_au/article/3dgpb3/the-sports-teams-who-defied-the-apartheid-boycott-of-south-africa,"<p>On 24 September 1968, the Marylebone Cricket Club announced that their tour of South Africa was cancelled. The newspaper prints whirred into action, as the resultant media frenzy began. The England cricket team had been due to travel to South Africa under the MCC's auspices, but were now informed that they would be staying home on account of the bitter controversy that had been swirling around the tour for months. That controversy centred on a polite, well-spoken, Cape Town-born all rounder named Basil D'Oliveira, who had been hoping to represent his adopted country, England, at the wicket and on the pitches laid over his native soil.</p><p>While D'Oliveira was an excellent cricketer, a consummate gentleman and, by most accounts, a thoroughly decent man, the South African government of the day had one major problem with him. The problem was that, as a man of mixed Indian and Portuguese heritage, he was a 'coloured' cricketer included to face an all-white South African team. The deeply unpleasant John Vorster, then National Party premier, was dead set against D'Oliveira's inclusion in the MCC squad, even if he tried to maintain a facade of conciliation in the months before the tour's scheduled start. As a former Nazi sympathiser and a staunch champion of apartheid, Vorster was never going to allow a supposed racial inferior to show his sporting worth and so embarrass his segregationist regime.</p><div class='article__media'><picture class='article__image'><source media='(max-width: 25em)' srcset='https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/02/09/the-sports-teams-who-defied-the-apartheid-boycott-of-south-africa-body-image-1486662182.jpg?resize=400:*, https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/02/09/the-sports-teams-who-defied-the-apartheid-boycott-of-south-africa-body-image-1486662182.jpg?resize=600:* 2x'><source media='(max-width: 40.625em)' srcset='https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/02/09/the-sports-teams-who-defied-the-apartheid-boycott-of-south-africa-body-image-1486662182.jpg?resize=650:*, https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/02/09/the-sports-teams-who-defied-the-apartheid-boycott-of-south-africa-body-image-1486662182.jpg?resize=975:* 2x'><source media='(max-width: 53.125em)' srcset='https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/02/09/the-sports-teams-who-defied-the-apartheid-boycott-of-south-africa-body-image-1486662182.jpg?resize=850:*, https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/02/09/the-sports-teams-who-defied-the-apartheid-boycott-of-south-africa-body-image-1486662182.jpg?resize=1275:* 2x'><source media='(max-width: 65.625em)' srcset='https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/02/09/the-sports-teams-who-defied-the-apartheid-boycott-of-south-africa-body-image-1486662182.jpg?resize=1050:*, https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/02/09/the-sports-teams-who-defied-the-apartheid-boycott-of-south-africa-body-image-1486662182.jpg?resize=1575:* 2x'><source media='(min-width: 65.625em)' srcset='https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/02/09/the-sports-teams-who-defied-the-apartheid-boycott-of-south-africa-body-image-1486662182.jpg?resize=1050:*, https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/02/09/the-sports-teams-who-defied-the-apartheid-boycott-of-south-africa-body-image-1486662182.jpg?resize=1575:* 2x'><img src='https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/02/09/the-sports-teams-who-defied-the-apartheid-boycott-of-south-africa-body-image-1486662182.jpg' alt=''></picture><p class='article__image-caption'>D'Oliveira playing against Pakistan in 1967 // PA Images</p></div><p>In the build-up to the tour, everything had been done to deter D'Oliveira from making himself available to selectors. In a series of cloak-and-dagger moves from English and South African cricketing officials and politicians, he was offered bribes, threatened, induced and cajoled, though none of these intrigues came to fruition. Unlike those plotting his exclusion from the team, D'Oliveira was a man of principle, character and firm resolution, and was not going to be denied the right to represent England in the same way he had been with South Africa. What's more, public opinion in Britain was solidly behind him. Attitudes towards apartheid were hardening, and the general consensus was that D'Oliveira's treatment at home and abroad was anything but cricket.</p><p>Though his selection was in doubt in the weeks leading up to the tour, an injury to bowler Tom Cartwright saw D'Oliveira included. Vorster reacted in predictable fashion, saying: 'We are not prepared to receive a team thrust upon us by people whose interests are not in the game but to gain certain political objectives which they do not even attempt to hide. The MCC team is not the team of the MCC but of the anti-apartheid movement.' If the snub to D'Oliveira wasn't enough, the insult to English cricket more generally helped to ferment public uproar. The MCC saw the light and cancelled the tour altogether, while Denis Howell, Labour's sports minister, called Vorster's accusations 'ludicrous.'</p><p>The D'Oliveira affair, as it would become known, did a huge amount for the anti-apartheid movement in Britain. It also increased the momentum of various efforts at sporting boycott, with the ICC imposing a moratorium on tours to South Africa in 1970. Though the Proteas were due to travel to England that year and the MCC were still happy for the return tour to go ahead, public opinion and political pressure saw them withdraw the invitation. At the same time, the South Africa rugby team's tour of England and Ireland was greeted by mass anti-apartheid demonstrations, including an attempt to hijack the team bus in London and a 'lie in' on the streets of Dublin which blocked the team's route to Lansdowne Road.</p><div class='article__media'><picture class='article__image'><source media='(max-width: 25em)' srcset='https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/02/09/the-sports-teams-who-defied-the-apartheid-boycott-of-south-africa-body-image-1486662428.jpg?resize=400:*, https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/02/09/the-sports-teams-who-defied-the-apartheid-boycott-of-south-africa-body-image-1486662428.jpg?resize=600:* 2x'><source media='(max-width: 40.625em)' srcset='https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/02/09/the-sports-teams-who-defied-the-apartheid-boycott-of-south-africa-body-image-1486662428.jpg?resize=650:*, https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/02/09/the-sports-teams-who-defied-the-apartheid-boycott-of-south-africa-body-image-1486662428.jpg?resize=975:* 2x'><source media='(max-width: 53.125em)' srcset='https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/02/09/the-sports-teams-who-defied-the-apartheid-boycott-of-south-africa-body-image-1486662428.jpg?resize=850:*, https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/02/09/the-sports-teams-who-defied-the-apartheid-boycott-of-south-africa-body-image-1486662428.jpg?resize=1275:* 2x'><source media='(max-width: 65.625em)' srcset='https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/02/09/the-sports-teams-who-defied-the-apartheid-boycott-of-south-africa-body-image-1486662428.jpg?resize=1050:*, https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/02/09/the-sports-teams-who-defied-the-apartheid-boycott-of-south-africa-body-image-1486662428.jpg?resize=1575:* 2x'><source media='(min-width: 65.625em)' srcset='https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/02/09/the-sports-teams-who-defied-the-apartheid-boycott-of-south-africa-body-image-1486662428.jpg?resize=1050:*, https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/02/09/the-sports-teams-who-defied-the-apartheid-boycott-of-south-africa-body-image-1486662428.jpg?resize=1575:* 2x'><img src='https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/02/09/the-sports-teams-who-defied-the-apartheid-boycott-of-south-africa-body-image-1486662428.jpg' alt=''></picture><p class='article__image-caption'>Demonstrators during South Africa's tour of England and Ireland in 1970 scale the posts // PA Images</p></div><p>It should be said that, prior to the D'Oliveira affair, several sporting boycotts of South Africa were already in action. The South African Football Association had been suspended by FIFA in 1961 for practising segregationist policies, while South Africa had been barred from the Tokyo Olympics in 1964. In early 1968, with the scandal concerning D'Oliveira in its incipient stages, the United Nations general assembly called for a boycott of all South African sports teams which were organised along apartheid lines. The majority of sporting bodies began to cut ties with South Africa, and the seventies and eighties saw them incrementally ostracised from cricket, rugby, track and field, golf, tennis and, from 1974 onwards, even chess.</p><p>That said, though sporting boycotts were backed by UN directive, they were not universally adhered to. In cricket and rugby union especially, there were teams who defied anti-apartheid sentiment and chose to tour South Africa regardless. Despite further sporting sanctions against South Africa, as well as the Gleneagles Agreement of 1977 – in which Commonwealth leaders further agreed to discourage links to South African sport – and the condemnatory 'Register of Sports Contacts with South Africa' set up to pressurise individual athletes by the United Nations in 1980, not everyone was deterred from maintaining relationships with apartheid-era teams.</p><p>At various points throughout the seventies, English county cricketer, businessman and sports promoter Derrick Robins organised private tours of South Africa. There were no sanctions against individual cricketers who toured the country at that point and, as such, despite condemnation by politicians, activists and many cricket fans, several big names in the sport decided to join him on these overseas jaunts, with the likes of Brian Close, Bob Willis and Tony Greig involved. Robins largely shrugged off the criticism his tours attracted, and even went as far as to suggest that by fielding multi-racial teams – West Indian cricketer John Shepherd was included on two of his tours – he was helping to break down apartheid. Naturally, not everyone bought this explanation, and perhaps owing in part to the reaction in Britain he made South Africa his part-time home from 1975.</p><p>After the Gleneagles Agreement and a series of increasingly strict motions from the ICC, there were still several excursions to South Africa which came to be known as rebel tours. Often made up of jaded veterans or naive youngsters and enticed by generous financial incentives from corporate sponsors – this in an attempt to avoid the furore that would have resulted from National Party financing – cricket teams from England, Sri Lanka, the West Indies and Australia went on a total of seven unofficial trips. The first of these was an 'English XI' led by Graham Gooch in 1982, with news of their tour only breaking when they arrived in Johannesburg that March. The 12 cricketers involved had planned the expedition in secret, and were prepared to ride out the public opprobrium and any sanctions issued by the ICC.</p><p class='article__blockquote'><b><a href='https://sports.vice.com/en_uk/article/remembering-formula-1s-long-relationship-with-apartheid-south-africa'>READ MORE: Remembering Formula 1's Long Relationship With Apartheid South Africa</a></b></p><p>Unfortunately for the rebels, the subsequent outcry was rather louder than they had expected. They were vilified back home by press and politicians, while condemnation of the tour made it into the Houses of Parliament where they were described as 'The Dirty Dozen' by Labour MP Gerald Kaufman. English cricket was dragged through the mud both domestically and internationally, both by the association with apartheid and the unseemliness of cricketers playing purely for money. For many, the rebels had gone against everything English cricket stood for, and all for a reported payday of around £40,000 to £60,000 each.</p><p>In South Africa, the team were lionised, with many newspapers heralding the homecoming of international cricket and predicting a return to the sporting fold. It was a domestic propaganda coup for the apartheid regime, which further damaged the touring team's reputation back home and abroad. The tour was a fiasco, with an underprepared, ageing and increasingly demoralised English team losing all their matches against South Africa. When they returned to England, they were met with a wall of anger. The rebels, who totalled 15 cricketers in the end including injury cover and late additions, were given three-year bans from international cricket, which in the cases of Geoffrey Boycott, Mike Hendrick, Geoff Humpage and Bob Woolmer effectively ended their international careers.</p><p>The Sri Lankan and West Indian rebel tours of the mid eighties were even more acrimonious, with many of the rebels' compatriots denouncing them as traitors and apartheid collaborators. All of those who participated received lifetime bans from their respective cricket boards, and often found themselves frozen out from social, civil and professional life. The issue of money was again controversial, making it easy for the press at home to characterise them as mercenaries who had sold out their countries. In the case of the West Indian tours, opinion was perhaps more divided, with some arguing that their good showings in South Africa were actually a public blow to racism and apartheid rhetoric.</p><p>Events in South Africa were moving rapidly at this point, with outbreaks of violent civil disorder serving as the backdrop to the rebel cricket matches. This seriously undermined the position of those who argued the tours were a positive, and it was suggested that they were being used to cover up the increasing brutality of the regime. In the midst of the two Australian tours of 1985/86 and 86/87 led by former Baggy Greens captain Kim Hughes, Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke openly called the travelling players 'traitors'. Speaking in a recent interview with <a href='http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/959689.html' target='_blank'>ESPN</a>, former rebel and Australian fast bowler Rodney Hogg said: 'I thought that if it was okay for Hawke to trade with South Africa, it was okay for me to go and play cricket there.'</p><p class='article__blockquote'><b><a href='https://sports.vice.com/en_uk/article/how-the-africa-cup-of-nations-became-a-powerful-propaganda-tool'>READ MORE: How the Africa Cup of Nations Became a Powerful Propaganda Tool</a></b></p><p>It was certainly true that there were some double standards at work when it came to boycotts of South Africa, with many governments encouraging business links to the country, tacitly or otherwise, while advocating sporting bans. With her administration blocking economic sanctions against the apartheid regime on multiple occasions, it's perhaps little surprise that Britain under Margaret Thatcher was the most regular contributor to rebel tours. Another English XI, featuring the likes of Mike Gatting, Tim Robinson, Bill Athey and Chris Broad, travelled to South Africa in early 1990, at a time when apartheid was near to collapsing and massive change was on the horizon. This was seen as especially crass, in that it was a last sop to a dying form of governance on the eve of Nelson Mandela's release.</p><p>Unlike the previous English rebel tour under Gooch, Gatting and co. were paid by the apartheid government, drawing widespread revulsion from the cricketing establishment and those watching developments at home. With South Africa gripped by protests as a result of their presence, the touring party were met with angry crowds and several seriously threatening situations. Once again, heavy bans and suspensions were handed out afterwards, and several careers came to a premature end. A follow-up tour in 1991 was unsurprisingly cancelled, with the disgrace of the first expedition more than enough for those involved.</p><p>During the eighties, in defiance of the Gleneagles Agreement, there were rugby tours to South Africa by the British and Irish Lions and England, while France and Ireland also travelled in the face of international reproof. Though the New Zealand and Australian governments barred their teams from traveling, a NZ 'Cavaliers' team toured the Republic in 1986. Virtually a first-string All Blacks side coached by Kiwi rugby legend Sir Colin Meads, the Cavaliers played four 'tests' against the Springboks, winning one and losing three.</p><p>While there was a certain square-jawed arrogance to the rugby establishment's reaction to protests, even they had to bow to public pressure and the Lions tour of 1986 was eventually called off. Nonetheless, South Africa remained a member of the International Rugby Board throughout the apartheid era, which is no doubt part of the reason that various national governing bodies maintained cordial relations with them. Unlike in cricket, where India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and the West Indies had a say, world rugby was still an overwhelmingly white sport and did little to show that it was inclined any other way.</p><p>As apartheid began to crumble as a policy in the early nineties, South African sports teams were slowly rehabilitated and the various sporting boycotts came to an end. The European Community announced the end to its members' boycotts in June 1991, while India ended its own veto on South African sport that same year. Soon enough, after the groundbreaking elections of 1994, South Africa were hosting the Africa Cup of Nations and winning the tournament with a multiracial team. There was also their iconic Rugby World Cup triumph in 1995, which for many seemed to usher in a new age of South African sport unshackled from the policies of the apartheid regime.</p><div class='article__media'><picture class='article__image'><source media='(max-width: 25em)' srcset='https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/02/09/the-sports-teams-who-defied-the-apartheid-boycott-of-south-africa-body-image-1486661801.jpg?resize=400:*, https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/02/09/the-sports-teams-who-defied-the-apartheid-boycott-of-south-africa-body-image-1486661801.jpg?resize=600:* 2x'><source media='(max-width: 40.625em)' srcset='https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/02/09/the-sports-teams-who-defied-the-apartheid-boycott-of-south-africa-body-image-1486661801.jpg?resize=650:*, https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/02/09/the-sports-teams-who-defied-the-apartheid-boycott-of-south-africa-body-image-1486661801.jpg?resize=975:* 2x'><source media='(max-width: 53.125em)' srcset='https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/02/09/the-sports-teams-who-defied-the-apartheid-boycott-of-south-africa-body-image-1486661801.jpg?resize=850:*, https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/02/09/the-sports-teams-who-defied-the-apartheid-boycott-of-south-africa-body-image-1486661801.jpg?resize=1275:* 2x'><source media='(max-width: 65.625em)' srcset='https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/02/09/the-sports-teams-who-defied-the-apartheid-boycott-of-south-africa-body-image-1486661801.jpg?resize=1050:*, https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/02/09/the-sports-teams-who-defied-the-apartheid-boycott-of-south-africa-body-image-1486661801.jpg?resize=1575:* 2x'><source media='(min-width: 65.625em)' srcset='https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/02/09/the-sports-teams-who-defied-the-apartheid-boycott-of-south-africa-body-image-1486661801.jpg?resize=1050:*, https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/02/09/the-sports-teams-who-defied-the-apartheid-boycott-of-south-africa-body-image-1486661801.jpg?resize=1575:* 2x'><img src='https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/02/09/the-sports-teams-who-defied-the-apartheid-boycott-of-south-africa-body-image-1486661801.jpg' alt=''></picture><p class='article__image-caption'>Mandela during the 1995 Rugby World Cup // PA Images</p></div><p>Watching this on television, at home in their armchairs or in their club bars, one wonders what the reaction was from those sportsmen who flew in the face of the sporting boycotts.

And not only good at football: he is the finest English footballer to ever live. I loathe this opinion. I hate it. But I am forced by law to write it, because it is objectively correct.</p><p>In his youth, Wayne Rooney attacked the ball like a pitbull grabs at a hen: instinctive, primal, with explosive results, blood all over the place. The mellow mid-career Rooney, one perfect third of that Ronaldo–Rooney–Tevez triumvirate, was something different: the ball, around him, slowed and dipped and did wonderful things, pinged into the net at speeds and angles that seemed impossible. Rooney possessed that odd knack known only to the best – the very, <i>very </i>best, the Messis and the Maradonas and the Ronaldinhos – where the ball always bounces for them, as if charmed.</p><p>And now, when we must admit that Wayne Rooney is on his descent, there are still moments where the ball comes near him and he does something so slick – just a touch, kills it dead, then zips a pass out to a teammate and moves, Wayne Rooney moving like a man chasing after a train, like his limbs are trying to run a marathon but his torso is trying desperately to explode – and you see a glimpse of what he was, what he always was and then was trained even more to be: an absolute, top pedigree, world class player.</p><p class='article__blockquote'><b><a href='https://sports.vice.com/en_uk/article/the-cult-titus-bramble'>READ MORE: The Cult – Titus Bramble</a></b></p><p>But then he also trod on Ricardo Carvalho's balls once and is really, really shit. So you see how Wayne Rooney is a man of depths, of extremes, of contrasts.</p><p>We are too close to the masterpiece to truly see it. In this analogy, and bear with me, we are an art critic and Wayne Rooney is the art. Wayne Rooney is the Mona Lisa, or something, although instead of smiling beatifically he is something else, his large freckled forehead scowling down into his nose, or his mouth is somehow so small and angry it seems it might suck in his ears, but a masterpiece nonetheless, and we, the art critics, have our nose up to it. That's where we are with Wayne Rooney – still only 31, still at Manchester United, still claws-on to a top-level career, still making his living as a footballer.</p><div class='article__media'><picture class='article__image'><source media='(max-width: 25em)' srcset='https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/02/07/the-cult-wayne-rooney-body-image-1486484545.jpg?resize=400:*, https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/02/07/the-cult-wayne-rooney-body-image-1486484545.jpg?resize=600:* 2x'><source media='(max-width: 40.625em)' srcset='https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/02/07/the-cult-wayne-rooney-body-image-1486484545.jpg?resize=650:*, https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/02/07/the-cult-wayne-rooney-body-image-1486484545.jpg?resize=975:* 2x'><source media='(max-width: 53.125em)' srcset='https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/02/07/the-cult-wayne-rooney-body-image-1486484545.jpg?resize=850:*, https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/02/07/the-cult-wayne-rooney-body-image-1486484545.jpg?resize=1275:* 2x'><source media='(min-width: 53.125em)' srcset='https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/02/07/the-cult-wayne-rooney-body-image-1486484545.jpg?resize=1000:*'><img src='https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/02/07/the-cult-wayne-rooney-body-image-1486484545.jpg' alt=''></picture><p class='article__image-caption'>PA Images</p></div><p>We will only be able to appreciate him truly, for what he was, in 10 years, long after next season's inevitable move to China, or the USA, two sputtering campaigns out there, wherever he ends up, making mega-money to occasionally shank sitters well wide. Then maybe he goes on a little run of goalscoring form, puts four past Guangzhou Evergrande, and the year is 2021 and England are faltering towards the end of a World Cup qualifying campaign, and there is talk – not whispers, actual talk – of maligned England boss Frank Lampard calling his old friend Rooney up to the fray. And he scores, inevitably, in a must-win 1-0 against Slovenia, ticking his England goals tally to a never-to-be-bettered 57. Then he retires, his knees gone, at 36. He's out of the public eye for a half-season before Rooney, hair finally shaved down to nothing, sits upright in a black-shirt-grey-trousers combo as an emergency pundit on Monday Night Football. And it's only then that we begin to realise.</p><p class='article__blockquote'><b><a href='https://sports.vice.com/en_uk/article/the-cult-roy-race'>READ MORE: The Cult – Roy of the Rovers</a></b></p><p>With the appearance of the next Young English Hope – some lad called Liam Felstead-Wickham, or something, just 16 and scoring two on his debut for Everton, born in the year of our lord 2010 – Wayne Rooney and the Flabby Banterous Remains of John Terry and Danny Murphy, for some reason, all chuckle on the sofa, and someone says: 'He reminds me of a young Wayne Rooney, wouldn't you say, Wayne?' Wayne demurs, rubs his nose with a single thumb and says: 'Well yeah, you know, obviously it's early days, but he's a good lad and a good boy – a lot of the coaches at Everton are dead excited about him, you know – so yeah.' And then they will run a highlights package of Wayne Rooney's career, Sky will, in glorious hyper HD – I mean, we'll probably all have 3D TVs by then, so imagine it in 3D, you with your crisps on the sofa watching as Wayne Rooney pops out of your television and scores a hat-trick against Fenerbache – and that's when you'll know. That's when we will – all of us – take a deep breath in and say:</p><p><i>Fuck.</i></p><p><i>FUCK!</i></p><p><i>Wayne Rooney was really fucking good at football!</i></p><p>But, right now, we're too close to it to know.</p><h3>Point of Entry: Both Brilliant and Shit</h3><p>Here's the story: 16-year-old Rooney went from 'whispered-about schoolboy' to 'Everton's great white hope' within the space of a month, making his debut in a 2-2 draw with Tottenham at the start of the 2002-03 season, then scoring two in the League Cup at Wrexham, then pelting the ball through Sol Campbell and David Seaman at once and shattering Arsenal's 30-game unbeaten run in doing so, and then, all of a sudden, we all knew about him. Rooney appeared at once unhewn and raw-edged and also magnificent, a running theme throughout his career. A lot of the uneasy chat about Rooney being a legend really seems to hinge on the fact that he appears brilliant and shit at the same time, and has done throughout his career (his 15 goals in 67 games for Everton is classic 'promising youngster if not amazing goalscorer' territory; his post-Euro 2004 England form has essentially been non-existent; and he is still an important player for Manchester United despite being consistently demonstrably bad at football). Two seasons at Everton and an England debut, followed by an incredible tournament in Portugal, meant that, inevitably, Rooney was ready for a step up, and he eventually moved to United for £25.6 million at just 18. And there he's been, chugging away, ever since.</p><p class='article__blockquote'><a href='https://sports.vice.com/en_uk/article/the-spirit-of-big-sam-compels-you-analysing-the-wayne-rooney-wine-fiasco'></a><b><a href='https://sports.vice.com/en_uk/article/the-spirit-of-big-sam-compels-you-analysing-the-wayne-rooney-wine-fiasco'>READ MORE: Analysing the Wayne Rooney Wine Fiasco</a></b></p><p>We talk about Rooney fulfilling or not fulfilling his potential as if winning every major domestic trophy and being his club and country's finest ever goalscorer is somehow falling short. His United career has encapsulated everything – five Premier League titles, one FA Cup, two League Cups, one Champions League, the Club World Cup, once, if that counts; red cards, injuries, goal droughts; transfer requests, the captaincy; <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6MkmonoaSw' target='_blank'>that Casillero del Diablo ad</a> – but arguably the moment that defined it was the cruciate injury he sustained against Bayern Munich in 2010. Rooney damaged his ankle in the March quarter-final, putting his World Cup place in doubt, but then, weirdly, showed up for the second leg just a week later. That's Rooney: in the prime of his career, the kind of player you can talk about making mega-money moves to other teams – that rare bird, 'the English footballer you can actually envision playing for a Spanish team' – but struggling on through a sub-par patch of fitness, because he had to, because he was a dynamo, because he loved to play. He wouldn't score for the rest of the season and had an absolutely shit World Cup. And, as much as I would like to end this paragraph with 'and he was never the same afterwards', he scored 27 goals the next season, so: what the fuck do I know?</p><p class='article__blockquote'><a href='https://sports.vice.com/en_uk/article/the-cult-ruud-van-nistelrooy'></a><b><a href='https://sports.vice.com/en_uk/article/the-cult-ruud-van-nistelrooy'>READ MORE: The Cult – Ruud Van Nistelrooy</a></b></p><p>Nothing about Rooney makes sense. He is often described as 'the last street footballer' – as academies gobble up youngsters and prime them for glossy careers from ever younger ages, Rooney is the last throwback to an era where kids actually liked playing football – but that tag seems to belie something else, something that makes him both messiah and villain in the English tabloids that love to build him up as much as tear him down. Rooney, the most exquisite player of an English generation, has resisted all attempts to polish his working-class roots away; he is, ultimately, just a half-shy lad from Croxteth who has scored more goals for Manchester United than anyone, ever, has scored more goals for England than anyone, ever, and stamped on Ricardo Carvalho's balls once. This is what makes him cult: that his highlight reel is one of extremes, from madness to majesty, and in the middle there's Rooney, doing that seagull-flap-face-scrunched-up thing he does at referees when a decision doesn't go his way, glowering pink-red in the middle of the field, and then scoring a brace in the Champions League, and earning £300,000 for it.</p><h3>The Moment: That Overhead Kick Against City, Possibly Via a Shin</h3><p>He shinned it. He shinned it. I am convinced he shinned it – I will go to my grave swearing that he shinned it – but the moment will always be That Overhead Kick Against City. Every single element of football came together at once, like the ending of three blockbuster movies, maybe four. You've got the evil-forces power beneath dark clouds on the near horizon (City, pre-title, shaping up under Sheikh Mansour); you've got the apple-and-Eden temptation that nearly lured Rooney across town just a year earlier (he re-signed, breaking United's wage structure in doing so, United's last talisman after Ronaldo); you've got the fact that a make-or-break February title four-pointer was poised at 1-1; you've got that classic, classic, United late goal. And then you have Wayne Rooney, backwards, for some reason, mid-air out of nowhere, and Nani has floated the ball in, and <i>pow</i>. He shinned it, definitely, because it pinged in off his shin, but that was it: a goal for Rooney, three points for United, a stride in the direction of Fergie's penultimate title, and Old Trafford explodes. These are the moments Rooney was made for. So much of the strength of his career comes from the fact that he's basically a headline writer's wet dream.</p><div data-iframely-id='wakuZhH' class='article__embed article__embed--iframely'><div style='left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.2493%;'><iframe style='border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;' allowfullscreen data-iframely-url='//oembed.vice.com/wakuZhH' frameborder='0'></iframe></div></div><h3>Closing Statements</h3><p>'Let me tell you a story about Wayne.

In comments that baffled much of the women's basketball world, Wiggins claimed she was forced into early retirement due to a lack of fan support and hostility toward her within the league that she attributed to her heterosexuality.</p><p>'I wanted to play two more seasons of WNBA, but the experience didn't lend itself to my mental state,' Wiggins said in an interview done in conjunction with her enshrinement in the San Diego Hall of Champions Bretibard Hall of Fame. 'It was a depressing state in the WNBA. It's not watched. Our value is diminished. It can be quite hard. I didn't like the culture inside the WNBA, and without revealing too much, it was toxic for me.... My spirit was being broken.'</p><p>Wiggins also said, 'I would say 98 percent of the women in the WNBA are gay women,' and ascribed difficulties to that difference in sexuality: 'People were deliberately trying to hurt me all of the time. I had never been called the B-word so many times in my life than I was in my rookie season. I'd never been thrown to the ground so much. The message was: 'We want you to know we don't like you.''</p><p>The comments came as a shock to many current and former WNBA players, who took to Twitter to register their objections.</p><div class='article__embed--twitter'><blockquote class='twitter-tweet' data-lang='en'>Bria Hartley, Mistie Bass, Dearrica Hamby & Taylor Hill have had babies in the past year.

What is key to that loyalty and support is our commitment to diversity and inclusion. As a union, we should and we will continue to celebrate the diversity that makes us special and lead by example. We must respect the rights of those we don't agree with when they speak their mind. Whether one agrees or disagrees with the comments made recently by a former player or whether one has seen or experienced anything like what she has described, anything that impacts an inclusive culture should be taken seriously.'</p><p>WNBA president Lisa Borders declined to comment through a spokesperson.</p><p>But so much about the Wiggins assertions did not compute. When Wiggins retired last spring, she <a href='http://www.theplayerstribune.com/candice-wiggins-liberty-wnba-retirement/' target='_blank'>pointed to the toll eight surgeries</a>, including five on her knees, had taken on her body. She even revealed she'd fallen out of love with the game of basketball. But one thing kept her going, she said: 'I haven't been playing professional basketball out of my own love, but instead, that of my fans, and all those who've supported me throughout a trying career. There's nothing I can do to express how thankful I am for the motivation. When times were difficult and I, again, found myself working to return to the court after an injury (but not knowing if I ever would), I'd think of my fans and how much they meant to me.'</p><p>So it was strange to hear Wiggins say this in Monday's story: 'Nobody cares about the WNBA. Viewership is minimal. Ticket sales are very low. They give away tickets and people don't come to the game.'</p><p>Leaving aside that this is demonstrably false and, in fact, trends are moving in the opposite direction (from <a href='http://www.wnba.com/news/record-breaking-attendance-five-years-digital-social-retail/' target='_blank'>ticket sales rising 4.6 percent</a> last season to television <a href='http://www.wnba.com/news/record-breaking-attendance-five-years-digital-social-retail/' target='_blank'>ratings up 11 percent nationally</a>), it's an odd trumpet of bitterness from a player who never spoke this way about the league during her career, while always eagerly speaking her mind.</p><p>It did raise some eyebrows when Wiggins revealed in the interview that she is working on an autobiography—and it is probably true that a book professing to reveal juicy details about the WNBA has a better chance of selling than one telling the broadly accurate story of a league engaged in slow, steady progress.</p><p>Still, it would be unfair to disregard a player asserting this, something reiterated by San Antonio Stars Monique Currie via her WomensBasketball247 Twitter account.</p><div class='article__embed--twitter'><blockquote class='twitter-tweet' data-lang='en'>I think her experiences need to be looked at seriously.

I don't need to explain, really.</p><p>I mean, the team knows it, too.

While there might be various other factors involved – tensions within the squad, managerial instability, financial problems off the pitch – the most common cause of relegation is that the players are simply not up to scratch. Barring a select few genius managers, there is little a coach can do with a squad which lacks the talent and ability to survive in the top flight, and so the simple truth is that relegation comes to those least capable. That said, over the decades, there have been several notable exceptions. In the history of English football, there are a small cabal of teams who shocked the nation by ending up in the drop zone, having been widely deemed too good to go down by fandom and commentariat alike.</p><p>The first of these teams was Aston Villa, no doubt the biggest club in England during the emergent years of the Football League. The Villans won the title six times between the league's inaugural season in 1988/89 and 1909/10, while also claiming victory in six FA Cup finals before the twenties were in full swing. They declined somewhat in the inter-war period, even if they were twice runners-up to Arsenal in the early thirties. Having been solidly mid-table over the course of the previous couple of seasons, they stunned fans up and down the country by dropping down to the Second Division at the end of the 1935/36 campaign, at a time when there were only two relegation places. Villa still had club stalwarts like Danny Blair, Ronnie Dix and the legendary Dai Astley in their ranks, and managed to go down alongside Blackburn despite outscoring most of the teams in the league. In hindsight, the frankly enormous 110 goals they conceded might have had something to do with the disastrous outcome of their season, though thankfully their improved defensive showings saw them bounce back as Second Division champions the following year.</p><p>The next side to suffer a shock demotion was the Manchester City side of 1937/38, who went down in perhaps the most spectacular fashion of all time. To this day, they remain the only side in history to have won the First Division title and been relegated the season afterwards. Managed by the brilliantly named Wilf Wild, City gained a reputation for playing some of the most expansive football in the country, crowned champions after scoring 107 goals and comprehensively demolishing their nearest rivals. Unfortunately, they became rather too expansive, as evidenced by the fact that they went down the next season with 80 goals and a positive goal difference to their name.</p><div class='article__media'><picture class='article__image'><source media='(max-width: 25em)' srcset='https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/01/18/too-good-to-go-down-the-best-sides-relegated-from-the-english-top-flight-body-image-1484765341.jpg?resize=400:*, https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/01/18/too-good-to-go-down-the-best-sides-relegated-from-the-english-top-flight-body-image-1484765341.jpg?resize=600:* 2x'><source media='(max-width: 40.625em)' srcset='https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/01/18/too-good-to-go-down-the-best-sides-relegated-from-the-english-top-flight-body-image-1484765341.jpg?resize=650:*, https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/01/18/too-good-to-go-down-the-best-sides-relegated-from-the-english-top-flight-body-image-1484765341.jpg?resize=975:* 2x'><source media='(min-width: 40.625em)' srcset='https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/01/18/too-good-to-go-down-the-best-sides-relegated-from-the-english-top-flight-body-image-1484765341.jpg?resize=800:*'><img src='https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/01/18/too-good-to-go-down-the-best-sides-relegated-from-the-english-top-flight-body-image-1484765341.jpg' alt=''></picture><p class='article__image-caption'>City players emerge from the tunnel during their title-winning season // PA Images</p></div><p>City were at least entertaining that season and, in the aftermath of their relegation, a football correspondent for <i>The Times </i>referred to them as 'a fantastically eccentric side.' Their fans had witnessed plenty of goalmouth action, even if much of it had been inauspicious and their team had failed to get the requisite results. That's more that could be said of their cross-town rivals during their own shock experience of the drop, which came at the end of the 1973/74 campaign. Manchester United had won the European Cup only five years previously, but eventually ended up mired in the bottom three with a tally of only 32 points. Even worse, they had found the net only 38 times all season, this despite boasting the talents of George Graham, Lou Macari, Sammy McIlroy and George Best, albeit not at his talismanic peak and in an increasingly mutinous mood.</p><p class='article__blockquote'><a href='https://sports.vice.com/en_uk/article/double-or-quits-the-glorious-cliche-of-the-relegation-six-pointer'></a><b><a href='https://sports.vice.com/en_uk/article/double-or-quits-the-glorious-cliche-of-the-relegation-six-pointer'>READ MORE: Double or Quits – The Glorious Cliche of the Relegation Six Pointer</a></b></p><p>To put into context just how dire United were that term, their goalkeeper, Alex Stepney, was the team's main source of goals for much of the season. Manager Tommy Docherty had decided to give him the responsibility of taking penalties and, having scored one in a loss to Leicester and another in a narrow win over Birmingham City, the man between the sticks found himself top of the scoring charts after 12 games. Remarkably, Stepney would remain the club's top scorer for another 10 matches, all the way up until late December. Come April, United's relegation was topped off with a famous goal from the iconic Denis Law, a man who had made over 400 appearances for the Old Trafford club before switching to Manchester City the season before.</p><div data-iframely-id='OLaKrim' class='article__embed article__embed--iframely'><div style='left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.2493%;'><iframe style='border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;' allowfullscreen data-iframely-url='//oembed.vice.com/OLaKrim' frameborder='0'></iframe></div></div><p>Speaking on <i>The Big Match </i>after the final whistle, a visibly dejected Docherty pulled no punches. He said of United's relegation: 'I'm upset for the players... I'm upset for the directors and the supporters, because I feel very ashamed and embarrassed to be in this position.' It was a momentous occurrence in English football, and saw one of the biggest clubs in the country tumble gracelessly out of the top tier. Docherty would keep his job regardless – hard to imagine now, given the extreme precariousness of modern football management – and lead United to an immediate promotion, vindicating his directors further when he subsequently won the FA Cup.</p><p>There were a few surprises over the course of the eighties, not least the relegation of Leeds United and Aston Villa. Both were huge clubs with recent honours, but had been gripped by a slow-burning sense of decline. Their relegations were less compelling than those of their predecessors, if only because they lacked that same shock factor. Indeed, football fans would have to wait until the heady days of the early nineties for the 'too good to go down' tag to be ostentatiously revived.</p><p class='article__blockquote'><a href='https://sports.vice.com/en_uk/article/the-unburstable-bubble-how-nottingham-forest-clinched-the-most-unlikely-title'></a><b><a href='https://sports.vice.com/en_uk/article/the-unburstable-bubble-how-nottingham-forest-clinched-the-most-unlikely-title'>READ MORE: How Nottingham Forest Clinched The Most Unlikely Title</a></b></p><p>The old cliche announced its nineties renaissance by first striking down Nottingham Forest, who finished bottom of the table in the Premier League's maiden campaign. This was a team that included the hardy talents of Scot Gemmill, Stuart Pearce and Roy Keane, all under the stewardship of the club's greatest ever manager, Brian Clough. Despite his legendary status, however, Clough's increasingly erratic behaviour and struggle with alcoholism were problematic. The loss of Teddy Sheringham at the start of the season was terminal for the team, and Forest's fate was ultimately decided by their incurable lethargy going forwards.</p><p>While Forest were a strong outfit, they had nothing like the financial backing of the Middlesbrough team which took up the torch of surprise relegation. Ahead of the 1996/97 season, Boro brought a series of exotic imports in the form of Juninho, Emerson, and Fabrizio Ravanelli, altogether at considerable cost. Funded by chairman and benefactor Steve Gibson, Bryan Robson's men were expected to challenge for European football. Instead, they muddled their way into the drop zone, and found that a needless mid-season points deduction was the difference between going down and staying up.</p><div data-iframely-id='7PEKi7i' class='article__embed article__embed--iframely'><div style='left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 75.0019%;'><iframe style='border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;' allowfullscreen data-iframely-url='//oembed.vice.com/7PEKi7i' frameborder='0'></iframe></div></div><p>That same season, Boro had to endure the pain of losing in both domestic cup finals, rounding off a thoroughly miserable year for the club. That was a fate which West Ham were thankfully spared during the 2002/03 campaign, though they also ended up falling headlong into the Championship in spite of their abundantly gifted squad. Where Bryan Robson had acted as the hapless managerial foil for Boro, Glenn Roeder played the part for the Hammers. His side, including the likes of David James, Michael Carrick, Joe Cole, Glen Johnson and Jermain Defoe, were relegated with a total of 42 points. In fairness, since the introduction of the 38-game season, that remains the most points accrued by a Premier League team who have ended up in the bottom three, not that statistics were much of a comfort when the squad was swiftly cannibalised by other clubs.</p><p>Perhaps the last side of the modern era whose relegation flew in the face of the consensus, Leeds United went down in flames at the conclusion of 2003/04. The club was struggling under a huge burden of debt but, nevertheless, could still call upon the services of Alan Smith, James Milner, Nick Barmby and Mark Viduka, to name but a few. Unfortunately, the ominous shadow of the club's creditors loomed increasingly large over proceedings, not helped by a perfect storm of player sales, managerial instability and a general malaise at almost every level. The club ended up six points from safety, and haven't played Premier League football since.</p><p>While we like to maintain the facade that the quality of the Premier League increases year on year, the truth is that there have been no real shocks amongst the relegation candidates of the last few years. Whether it be promoted sides painfully low on quality or mismanaged giants like Newcastle and Aston Villa, the teams who make up the bottom three these days are often appallingly poor to watch. Nonetheless, in time, the old cliche will strike again. While quality and talent might decide the matter in the vast majority of cases, the truth is that there is no such thing as a team which is too good to fail.<br></p><p><a href='https://twitter.com/W_F_Magee' target='_blank'></a><b><i><a href='https://twitter.com/W_F_Magee' target='_blank'>@W_F_Magee</a></i></b></p>","Football, premier league, Leeds United, Manchester United, Aston Villa, nottingham forest, middlesbrough, relegation shocks and surprises, Manchester City, west ham, west ham united, Leeds, relegation, english football"

The following season saw a third-placed finish for the <i>Partenopei </i>(a nickname for both club and city derived from Greek mythology, specifically the siren <i>Parthenópē</i>).

He partied with <i>camorra</i> bosses and a paternity suit was brought against him by a local woman over a child that she had named Diego Armando.

The venue, of course, would be Naples.</p><p>Maradona, as only Maradona could, appealed to the locals to support him and Argentina above the <i>Azzurri</i>. His message to the city was clear: ''For 364 days out of the year, you are considered to be foreigners in your own country; today you must do what they want by supporting the national team. Instead, I am a Neapolitan for 365 days out of the year.' In Diego's mind, he had taken Naples on his back and carried them, but as the teams walked on to the field the banner on the <i>curva</i> read: 'Maradona, Naples loves you, but Italy is our country'.

The treatment of OJ Simpson by the LAPD. <i>Bam!</i> Straight in there with it, like the shoulder of the Juice through the clutches of a linebacker, back when he was – with no caveats on this at all – the most popular sportsman in America. That's the kind of fame visible from space. And yet, interestingly, it was roughly one-third as famous as he was going to get. His name has now entered the shorthand section of the English language, along with things like Titanic, and using the suffix -gate to denote a scandal.</p><p>Prior to really knowing the substance of his trial, I had some half-baked sense that 'racism' was a key factor that allowed OJ Simpson to murder two people, brutally, be basically the only suspect in a 100-mile radius, and walk out of court a free man. It always crossed my mind that whatever those factors may have been, he must have had an unfathomably good defence team to work it to the point that he was acquitted. As it turned out, upon learning more about the case, racism was indeed the key – the only – factor in his acquittal. The racism of the jury, made up of nine black people, two white people, and one Hispanic person. The only truly significant achievement of his defence team was securing a jury of that profile – a jury who presumably, growing up in LA, could tell you a few stories about how racism looked when it was being used against them by the LAPD and all-white juries. OJ, a shining symbol of black success, vs. White People.

When I was young, when life was simple, the workings of the grown-ups' legal system was as elementary as Father Christmas – it came, in the right way, to the right place. That a courtroom could feature such bristling racial grievances, a prosecution team so utterly complacent in their certainty of winning that they made every conceivable mis-step, a judge so overawed by his 15 minutes of fame he exercised all the judicial oversight of a packet of crisps, and that the jury could just palpably get bored and stop listening to the mounting, irrefutable evidence of OJ's guilt – this, to me as a child, wasn't a possibility. Grown-ups knew what they were doing.</p><p class='article__blockquote'><a href='https://sports.vice.com/en_uk/article/the-cult-michael-vick'></a><b><a href='https://sports.vice.com/en_uk/article/the-cult-michael-vick'>READ MORE: The Cult – Michael Vick</a></b></p><p>You wonder how it is for kids now, given what they see.

Are you out of your mind? Via the power of his Cult persona, OJ Simpson managed to defeat the kind of evidence that, if you presented about an eighth of it in an average case, would get 100% of everyone locked up for life without parole. Blood from OJ Simpson was found at the house of his murdered ex-wife, Nicole. Blood from Ron Goldman, her lover, who OJ had never met, was found on the inside of OJ's car parked outside his house. A limo driver dispatched to take OJ to the airport on the evening of the murder had clear evidence that OJ was not, as he claimed, at home the entire time. Oh, and the LAPD had what amounted to a case-closed history of OJ beating the shit, repeatedly, out of Nicole, to the point that she was making 911 calls like the one below.</p><div data-iframely-id='EKNJlzd' class='article__embed article__embed--iframely'><div style='left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 75.0019%;'><iframe style='border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;' allowfullscreen data-iframely-url='//oembed.vice.com/EKNJlzd' frameborder='0'></iframe></div></div><p>But OJ had been assiduously courting the LAPD for years, to the point that they stopped by at the house of this NFL Hall-of-Famer unannounced, to take a swim in his pool and listen to some old war stories. The great irony of the racist forcefield thrown around OJ by the jury – and one beautifully captured in Jeffrey Toobin's <i>The People vs. OJ</i>, the only book you need on the subject – is that by the time of the murder OJ was basically a stereotypical white person. His milieu was corporate golf events, country clubs, obsequiously good relationships with the local police. His richest period was when corporate America fixed on him as a good person to advertise products to white America far more than black. Nonetheless, black America, or at least the black America that a complacent prosecution team couldn't really be arsed to prevent the defence from weighting the jury with, saw him as an example of one of their own who'd made America bow. I think inside a whole lot of Americans beats the desire to do something on the big stage, when all the cameras and lights of that cultish ferment are poised – and here, for any of them on the jury, was a chance to stick it to the LAPD's treatment of them, which at that point sometimes included <a href='https://latimesphoto.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/fa_153_batteringram970.jpg' target='_blank'>having the front wall of your house caved in by a tank</a> in case there was evidence of gang activity going on inside.</p><p>I'm ambivalent as to whether OJ getting off was unfair. Of course, via the legal system, it was unfair, and it's good that about five minutes later and by a somewhat more focused prosecution team he was found entirely guilty in the civilian case, and karma hasn't exactly afforded him a happy life since. But in the context of the American black experience with the legal system, was it unfair? Something to think about.</p><h3>The Moment – The prosecution screws up 'the glove that didn't fit'</h3><p>About the most famous line from the trial was 'If the glove doesn't fit, you must acquit', used by OJ's defence lawyers regarding a glove found dumped behind buildings on his property. Here are some facts about those gloves, to demonstrate quite what a car-crash the prosecution was. One was found at the murder scene, the other near OJ's house. That, your honour, is pretty compelling. They were rare as fuck – 'You have no idea how rare these gloves are', said the general manager of Aris, the gloves' manufacturer. They were only sold in the U.S. at Bloomingdale's, and only a fraction of them in an extra large size. And wouldn't you know it, Nicole Simpson had a credit card receipt for two pairs in extra large. I mean <i>seriously</i>, in a fair trial a team comprising a horse and a goldfish with a day to prepare could win this case.</p><div data-iframely-id='N5uw8z7' class='article__embed article__embed--iframely'><div style='left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.2493%;'><iframe style='border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;' allowfullscreen data-iframely-url='//oembed.vice.com/N5uw8z7' frameborder='0'></iframe></div></div><p>But, amazingly, the gloves didn't fit OJ when he demonstrated trying to put them on in court. Just kidding – they didn't fit when he demonstrated trying to put them on in the manner of someone trying to <i>not</i> fit a pair of gloves, like something you picture in a Charlie Chaplin film. This is where another car-crash element comes in: the judge, Lance Ito, who had been so addled by the whole frenzy that he simply let OJ stand there clowning.

23,2017-04-06,59031493291089E5765CC953,VICE Sports,en_uk,We Asked VICE Staff About Their Worst Experiences at the Football - VICE Sports,http://sports.vice.com/en_uk/article/aebnpe/we-asked-vice-staff-about-their-worst-experiences-at-the-football,"<p>Football is a contradiction. It is joy and sorrow, pleasure and pain, camaraderie and crushing loneliness, euphoric hope and the inky blackness of despair. Here, we have convinced a handful of VICE staff to tell us about the cruelty of football; the dark side of the contradiction within the game. One of them – though we can't say which one – is the man crying beneath this synthetic wig:</p><h3>SHAUN SAVAGE – CREATIVE</h3><p>As we grow up and life becomes increasingly complicated, sprawling and textured, football's ability to napalm your mood, outlook and sense of priority wanes. And that's a very good thing. However, at 15 years old – when life is reduced to a series of concerns relating solely to your football team, Three6Mafia mixtapes and an inability to chirpse girls properly – a joyless 2-1 home defeat to Wycombe Wanderers is capable of delivering trauma to both heart and head.</p><p>At the end of the 2000-01 season, my beloved Bristol Rovers needed to beat Wycombe to maintain any hope of Second Division survival. My memories of the game are admittedly patchy. The first half was eventless and definitely goalless. I remember a very young Nathan Ellington, and very old Mark Walters, both hitting the woodwork – this before Wycombe scored two quick goals midway through the second half. We got a goal back (which I remember) apparently through Kevin Gall (who I most certainly do not) to make it 2-1. But it was all in vain. Vitali Astafjevs, our future Latvia captain, was scythed down for a criminally unawarded penalty in the 90th minute, and we were unceremoniously relegated to the bottom tier of the Football League.</p><p>At the final whistle hundreds of people piled onto the pitch to vent their anger at the board and swear their heads off. Teenagers cried. Angry fat men bellowed their discontent at the efforts of reasonably well conditioned athletes. Some people were just utterly distraught – each of them wandering around aimlessly, wearing the bewildered expression of someone who'd just found out their favourite uncle had been picked up by Yewtree. Me and my mates Westy, Al, Dan and Will just kinda hung around on the terrace, muted and probably a bit embarrassed that we cared so much, before facing up to the prospect of going into school on Monday and being confronted by a braying bunch of Shitheads (our term for Bristol City fans). One hope was that we might actually win something the following season, though we were only promoted via the play-offs six years later. It felt really fucking bleak. But it benchmarked something.</p><p>In my lifetime, Rovers have never won anything beyond the odd play-off final and derby. But success is also relative. It's the poverty of silverware, and the genuine sense of loss I felt after that Wycombe match, that make moments like some of those we've had this season feel like paradise.</p><p>It's those periods between desire and gratification – via any number of bruises, flirtations, disappointments and mediocrities – that make supporting a genuinely shit football team a unique form of torture. Any successes, however minor or fleeting, always feel like rare moments of affection in the midst of an unhappy marriage. In football, as in life, you always lack more than you have – and that's kind of beautiful, in its own way.</p><h3>ANTH STOCKDALE – OFFICE DJ</h3><p>As a Sunderland fan, it has to be going to Chelsea away – full stop.</p><p>Having heat lamps on the roof and having to take my jacket off during a winter fixture is the sort of modern football bullshit that would make my coalmining grandfather turn in his grave. Also, having nothing but bottles of Tiger beer and some kind of 'waffle-fries' shit on the menu at half time was an insult to the beautiful game.</p><p>Never again.</p><h3>JON KEARNS – ADVERTISING/MARRIAGE EXPERT</h3><p>Just six months into my own wonderful marriage, and my beautiful American wife had the forethought to get us tickets and a weekend away to see Liverpool play West Ham at Anfield. It was January 2015 and just around peak optimism time for Liverpool fans in the post-Suarez, pre-Klopp era. The team had navigated the tricky Christmas period with four wins in five, and Sturridge was back from injury (this at a time when many Liverpool fans still had vain hopes he could develop into Suarez 2.0). I was a little disappointed not to see Gerrard play and it was a freezing cold January afternoon, but watching Liverpool win 2-0 – with goals from Sturridge and Sterling – was all I could ask for really, and it was all thanks to my dearly beloved huddled next to me in the northern English chill.</p><p>It wasn't until we were on the bus back to town after the game that I suddenly looked at her and made a face of such utter dismay that she still teases me about it two years on. In the freezing cold – and despite wearing gloves – I had managed to lose my wedding ring. I was devastated and, after scrabbling around coat pockets and bus floors, I quickly realised it must have been at half-time, when I took my gloves from my cold-shrivelled hands to pay for the tea and hot chocolate. I wanted to leap off the bus and run back to the ground to search for the ring, so frantic was my sense of panic. In my newlywed naivety<b>, </b>and still sounding out our transatlantic cultural differences (the wedding was a <i>big</i> deal), I had no idea how upset she was going to be. To my mind, this was an almost marriage-ending disaster. How had I managed to lose it without noticing? She'd gone and arranged all this for me – you'd think the least I could do was pay basic care and attention to the symbol of our undying love.</p><p>As it turned out, she was remarkably chill about the loss. She concluded, to the slight bruising of my supposed bread-winner ego: 'At least it wasn't that expensive a ring to lose.' Finally she determined, with the sort of pragmatism that made me marry her in the first place: 'Well if you were going to leave me for anyone, I'd rather it be for Anfield than another woman.'</p><div class='article__media'><picture class='article__image'><source media='(max-width: 25em)' srcset='https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/04/05/vice-writers-on-their-worst-ever-experiences-at-the-football-body-image-1491396015.jpg?resize=400:*, https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/04/05/vice-writers-on-their-worst-ever-experiences-at-the-football-body-image-1491396015.jpg?resize=600:* 2x'><source media='(max-width: 40.625em)' srcset='https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/04/05/vice-writers-on-their-worst-ever-experiences-at-the-football-body-image-1491396015.jpg?resize=650:*, https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/04/05/vice-writers-on-their-worst-ever-experiences-at-the-football-body-image-1491396015.jpg?resize=975:* 2x'><source media='(max-width: 53.125em)' srcset='https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/04/05/vice-writers-on-their-worst-ever-experiences-at-the-football-body-image-1491396015.jpg?resize=850:*, https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/04/05/vice-writers-on-their-worst-ever-experiences-at-the-football-body-image-1491396015.jpg?resize=1275:* 2x'><source media='(max-width: 65.625em)' srcset='https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/04/05/vice-writers-on-their-worst-ever-experiences-at-the-football-body-image-1491396015.jpg?resize=1050:*, https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/04/05/vice-writers-on-their-worst-ever-experiences-at-the-football-body-image-1491396015.jpg?resize=1575:* 2x'><source media='(min-width: 65.625em)' srcset='https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/04/05/vice-writers-on-their-worst-ever-experiences-at-the-football-body-image-1491396015.jpg?resize=1050:*, https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/04/05/vice-writers-on-their-worst-ever-experiences-at-the-football-body-image-1491396015.jpg?resize=1575:* 2x'><img src='https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/04/05/vice-writers-on-their-worst-ever-experiences-at-the-football-body-image-1491396015.jpg' alt=''></picture><p class='article__image-caption'>PA Images</p></div><h3><b>WILL MAGEE – VICE SPORTS UK STAFF WRITER</b><br></h3><p>They are a strange breed, are they not, away fans? They are a tribal bunch, a collective throwback to a time when human societies were organised on a much smaller level. They gather together in their little groups on the morning of matchday, each carpool a little band of hunter gatherers, a clan of cavemen ready to go to battle with some rival tribe across the windblown steppe. There they are, the away boys, armed not with the handcrafted spears of prehistory but rather with chants, with tins, with the boisterous aura of several grown men who are willing to fight and die for each other – or at least say so repeatedly – on the way to Carlisle, or Grimsby, or whichever post-industrial town happens to be hosting this weekend's game.</p><p>There is something atavistic about committed away fans, something primeval. These are men – for they almost invariably are men – who can turn a train carriage into a territorial wrangle, them against the common commuters and innocent non-footballing bystanders of the world. These are men who will belt out lewd songs mere metres away from a family of four, the children shrinking embarrassedly into their window seats, the dad turning an incandescent shade of scarlet, visibly getting angrier and angrier but realising that he, the lone alpha, is hopelessly outnumbered. There is something terrible about away fans, with their chest-beating masculinity and their strength-in-numbers bravado, exuding a fug of testosterone and antagonism as they hurtle towards their destination. Nonetheless, sneakingly, we want to go amongst them. Much like some eccentric primatologist who lives amongst mountain gorillas for months on end, a part of us wants to cultivate their acceptance so that we may see through their eyes, gradually follow their lead in shedding our own civilised pretensions and, eventually, learn to imitate their wild and exhilarating ways.</p><p>Still, much like the existence of a gorilla or prehistoric caveman, the life of an away fan can be brutal and unforgiving. While the away fan has a primal sense of camaraderie to keep him warm at night, he must brave many a frosty terrace and shite performance on the road in return. It was in the icy winter of 2012 when I learnt this for myself, in what would be my first and last long-distance journey to support the football club of my youth. That journey saw me rock up in the heart of Bradford, ready to watch Arsenal notch up a routine League Cup win at Valley Parade.</p><p>Accompanied by a friend who was making the near 600 mile round trip from Exeter – please bear his costly personal odyssey in mind come the conclusion of this anecdote – the life of an away fan showed promising beginnings. There were cans, there were chants and there was the warm embrace of an away pub, another aspect of the away days phenomenon which makes the whole thing feel like a primitive territorial feud. It was cruelly, bitterly, achingly cold, with the sharp Bradfordian air slicing through jackets, bobble hats and human bone, each gust of wind like a shard of glass through our flesh. Still, it would all be worth it, with the discomfort no doubt fading in the memory once our North London tribe had won the day.</p><p>Of course, Arsenal did not record a routine win against fourth-division Bradford City. Instead, they crashed out of the League Cup with possibly their easiest ever run to the final, this at a time when the club had gone without silverware for almost a decade. Not only that, it was one of the worst performances of all time and included <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjWphnVEQjc' target='_blank'>this spectacular miss</a> from the man, the legend, Gervinho, of which we had a fantastic view. To top it all off, Arsenal managed to take it to penalties before losing, hence causing frostbite amongst many of the huddled nomads in the away end.</p><p>It was at that moment that, looking at the faces around me, I came to the realisation that I did not have it in me to live amongst the away fans. I did not have the fortitude to survive alongside these cold and thwarted hunter gatherers, these hardiest and most heartbroken of men.</p><h3>AARON GORDON – VICE SPORTS US STAFF WRITER<br></h3><p>The worst soccer experience I ever had was a 2013 MLS game between the Vancouver Whitecaps and the Seattle Sounders. The game was perfectly fine, to be honest. The bad part was the person in front of me had the worst body odour I have ever experienced in my entire life. I almost threw up it was so rancid, but there was nothing I could do about it. I just had to stand there and take it for two hours. Please don't make me think about it any longer.

First football match: slow slumping 1-3 home loss at Chesterfield, 1997, don't even remember the opposition but when the announcer struggled with the vaguely foreign name of an away team substitute someone in the crowd shouted 'Who?' to a cacophony of that grim sort of football stand laughter, the bad laughter, the dark laughter, the one that I – a particularly wimpy 10-year-old, even for a 10-year-old – cowered to hear.</p><p>Subsequent football matches: another drizzle-strewn 1-1 at Saltergate; a handful of England games at Wembley, ones I'm pretty sure I only ended up at because of some sort of ticket scam (a friend of mine from back home used to get these England tickets face-value from 'a guy at work', who used to go – religiously – to England away days. 'It's a jolly, in't it!' he would say, the guy at work, 'it's good! See European countries. 40p, a pint, in Macedonia,' but then curiously he would go to literally zero home games, and we puzzled over it for a while, why he would buy the tickets but not go, or sell us the tickets at face value, Do You Not Want To Go Yourself, we would ask him, Are You Sure, and then walking up Wembley Way once we figured it out at the bag searches: of course, of course, our guy was banned from Wembley for violence, and only went to away games so he could cave in the heads of new, extravagant and continental skulls, of course he was, of course); the FA Cup youth final between Arsenal and Liverpool, where Jack Wilshere was making his name, but me, in my infinite wisdom, walked away from the match talking up the quality of Francis Coquelin (???????) and Kyle Bartley (??????), Such Good Movement, I would say, Bartley Will Be At The Heart of The Arsenal Defence For Years to Come, Proper Ball Playing Centre Back, him.</p><p>Maybe I don't appreciate live football because I'm an idiot who knows nothing about the sport, admittedly, but I think there's something more: I just don't understand the buzz of it, the up-on-your-feet of it. I get self-conscious shouting along with chants I don't know the words to, saying 'go ON!' in that performative way, more for the hard lad behind me in the stands than for the winger it was intended for. I don't think I've ever seen a live goal – apart from Yaya Sanogo's two-minute heartstopper against Borussia Dortmund, 2014 – that made me think anything other than 'eh' and 'I need to stand up now'. I recently went to an Arsenal game – Arsenal, slumping awfully at home to Southampton, a truly atrocious League Cup game – and didn't manage to make it to my seat until the 35th minute, because the checks and queues at the gate I was going in through were so extreme.</p><p>Every time I've been to a game in modern times, all the fun has been stripped out of it – the bag searches, the pat downs, the frantic queue for an £8 hotdog and a £6 beer in a plastic cup, then you run back out to the stands, leaving the spirit of fun behind you in the foyer – sort of like going to the cinema, if the cinema smelt of grass and you felt nothing as the images on the screen flitted by. Listen, I'm like you: I don't want anyone ripping a plastic chair out of some concrete and battering my head in with it. But I do want to feel alive a little. Watching football in the pub: a joy. Watching at home with some cans, crisps and mates: one of my favourite things to do in the entire world. Going to an actual game, trudging in and then out, watching from a weird angle, the walk back to the station with all the grim mutterings of loss, or the quiet that'll-do joy of a routine win? Eh, it's not for me. I'm glad you like it – truly, I am.

The Swiss company is working in collaboration with marketing groups, broadcasters, and reputable promoters from the boxing universe.</p><p>'It is Comosa's ambition to turn the World Boxing Super Series into the world's biggest and best boxing tournament,' <a href='http://www.bbc.com/sport/boxing/39224391' target='_blank'>said</a> Roberto Dalmiglio, Comosa's head of management board. 'The World Boxing Super Series will change the world of boxing.'</p><p>The tournament is planned for two yet-to-be determined weight classes that will feature eight fighters in each division. Participants will be competing for the Muhammad Ali Trophy, a concept developed by FIFA World Cup trophy designer Silvio Gazzaniga, and $50 million in prize money. While the amount will be spread throughout the tournament, it's been estimated that the final bout could result in as much as $10 million for the tournament winner, a substantial amount compared to the average boxing purse.</p><p>Veteran promoters Richard Schaefer and Kalle Sauerland are also backing the venture – Sauerland being one of Europe's biggest promotional names, and Schaefer being the former CEO of Golden Boy Promotions and founder of Ringstar Sports. Names such as these certainly boost the legitimacy of the tournament.</p><p>'I was sceptical at first but went into the meeting with an open mind,' <a href='http://www.espn.com/boxing/story/_/id/18868583/world-boxing-super-series-tournament-offer-50-million-prize-money' target='_blank'>said</a> Schaefer. 'When I started to realise the quality of the material, the quality of the people, I immediately knew this is going to be something I not only wanted to be involved in, but I know will succeed. These are people who not only have passion and deep pockets for the sport, these are people with the expertise to execute a tournament like this at the highest level.'</p><div data-iframely-id='fWzoA3s' class='article__embed article__embed--iframely'><div style='left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.2493%;'><iframe style='border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;' allowfullscreen data-iframely-url='//oembed.vice.com/fWzoA3s' frameborder='0'></iframe></div></div><p>So why exactly is this happening? Well, with the way boxing is currently organised, the sport is a mess. There are four recognised sanctioning bodies, meaning there can be up to four different champions in a given weight class, and four different ranking systems. Sometimes the champion of one sanctioning body is not even acknowledged in the rankings of another. Very seldom is there a unified champion (let alone an undisputed one), so this leaves the public unclear as to who's who in the sport. This sort of confusion affects viewership, i.e. boxing's financial lifeline, and a tournament such as this is meant to clear up that confusion.<br></p><p>This certainly isn't a new idea. In 2001, Don King's 'Middleweight World Championship Series' took four fighters (three of whom were belt holders), and produced an undisputed champion named Bernard Hopkins. For the four following years, boxing had a clear and distinct middleweight champion.</p><p>In more recent time, Showtime put on the 'Super Six World Boxing Classic', which featured six of the sport's best super-middleweights spread over four countries. Though the tourney did not produce so definitive an answer as its predecessor, it did give us Andre Ward as the winner, who has since dominated the super middleweight division, and is now doing considerably well in the light heavyweight division. If anything, tournaments like these can potentially force a division's best to face one another.</p><p>But there are also some problems as well. With the frequency that fighters entering the ring nowadays, a tournament involving eight fighters could drag on well beyond the public's patience, such as two-plus years of the 'Super Six'. This could also mean contractually binding participants to fight only other tournament participants, and potentially prevent other intriguing bouts from happening. For instance, then IBF super middleweight champ Lucian Bute and WBO champ Robert Stieglitz were not included in the 'Super Six' and were therefore not able to fight any of the tournament participants for over two years. And even if they were able to, say Bute or Stieglitz beat a tourney fighter with the tournament still ongoing – and said fighter went on to win the entire thing – is that really the best fighter of the division, or is the victor from outside of the tournament the best? It's hard to say.</p><p>Then there is the issue with the 'larger-than-boxing' personalities in the sport.</p><p>'We want to focus on weight classes that might've been a bit ignored,' Schaefer continued. 'We want to bring those fighters to the forefront and expose them.'</p><p>There could be some merit to that notion, but the real reason is probably that fighters in the less popular weight classes are willing to participate for smaller purses. That is one of the reasons Showtime was able to pull off the 'Super Six' in the first place, because the super middleweight division was largely unknown at the time. Accordingly, don't expect a tourney that includes Manny Pacquiao or Canelo Álvarez anytime soon, because though $50 million may appear as a large bankroll, it's still not big enough to meet the demands of the biggest names in boxing.</p><p>Overall, though, the tournament is a step in the right direction. Sauerland, the architect behind the tournament, has since learned from the 'Super Six', which he also managed. There are already talks with sanctioning bodies so mandatory title defences don't get in the way, and a list of reserve fighters are being planned for injuries and other setbacks which may rule out a participant. Dates have even been penciled in to prevent the tournament from dragging on, with opening bouts scheduled for September and October, semi-finals in January and February, and finals around May of next year. That is by no means an unreasonable timetable.</p><p>While there are still plenty of details to be worked out between all parties involved, it is an ambitious venture that hopefully carries good intentions along with it. And given the way the current landscape of boxing is structured, any attempts to help clarify the confusion is more than welcome for spectators and fans.</p>","Fightland, richard schaefer, boxing, kalle sauerland, World Boxing Super Series"
25,2017-04-06,590314D3879233E5644AC1B5,VICE Sports,en_uk,"At The Vanguard: Paolo Sollier, Italian Football’s Die-Hard Left Winger - VICE Sports",http://sports.vice.com/en_uk/article/vv9g7y/at-the-vanguard-paolo-sollier-italian-footballs-die-hard-left-winger,"<p>While Paolo Sollier spent the best part of two decades playing the beautiful game in Italy, there is one defining image of his career. Other footballers might find themselves most associated with a particular goal or celebration, but Sollier is most easily recognised by a photograph taken just before kick off. Wearing a shirt as red as his politics, brow furrowed and face furnished with a rough brown beard, Sollier is raising his left fist in the photo and clenching it in a traditional communist salute. This was a weekly ritual for Sollier, and it made him as popular among his compatriots on the radical left as it did despised by their right-wing adversaries. In the feverish political climate of Italy in the sixties and seventies, making such a statement was not inconsequential, and as such Sollier marked himself out as a footballing radical and a man unafraid.<br></p><p>Though Sollier identified with the left-wing movement as a player, he is perhaps best understood as a non-conformist and contrarian. Even when it comes to the photograph which helped to make him a counterculture icon in his home country, he has his qualms. Speaking in <a href='http://cinquantamila.corriere.it/storyTellerArticolo.php?storyId=0000002247092' target='_blank'>a 2013 interview</a> with Italian journalist Andrea Scanzi, he said of the picture: 'I never liked it... and not because of my closed fist, but because of my grumpy face. I am not a grumpy guy, I like to laugh.' While this may only have been a semi-serious assessment, it is nonetheless telling that even when it comes to that bold and defiant image, Sollier views himself with a critical eye.</p><p class='article__blockquote'><a href='https://sports.vice.com/en_uk/article/clough-shankly-busby-ferguson-the-golden-age-of-the-socialist-manager'></a><b><a href='https://sports.vice.com/en_uk/article/clough-shankly-busby-ferguson-the-golden-age-of-the-socialist-manager'>READ MORE: Clough, Shankly, Busby, Ferguson – The Golden Age of the Socialist Manager</a></b></p><p>For many, the sight of an unrepentant communist on the football pitch was doubtlessly distasteful, and it should be said that Sollier's politics were not of the moderate kind. Having started out in his early years as a volunteer with Mani Tese, an Italian non-profit organisation working towards equality, social justice and sustainable development, Sollier soon joined the <i>Avanguardia Operaia</i> (or 'Workers' Vanguard') of which he was a member at the height of his career. Made up of workers, trade unionists, students and intellectuals, the Vanguard had a broadly Leninist alignment and was involved in militant protests, as well as sporadic outbursts of extreme violence between its members and their bitter enemies on the right. He was later involved with successor party <i>Democrazia Proletaria </i>('Proletarian Democracy'), an inclusive communist alliance with an environmentalist, anti-authoritarian and pacifist stance.</p><p>Though Sollier's political position was obvious enough to fans from the get go, it came to the attention of the general public with his rise up the leagues to Serie A and the publication of his autobiography, <i>Calci e Sputi e Colpi Di Testa </i>('Kicking and Spitting and Head Shots') in 1976. On a basic level, the book documented his rise to prominence with Perugia, though it was obviously about far more than just football. Not only did Sollier discuss his affiliation with <i>Avanguardia Operaia </i>and his subscription to their newspaper, the aptly named <i>Daily Worker</i>, he also wrote about Italian society, the ethics of the dressing room and the political implications of the game. Naturally, his criticisms – often searing – made him anything but universally popular, and by all accounts he remains a divisive figure in Italy to this day.</p><div class='article__media'><picture class='article__image'><source media='(max-width: 25em)' srcset='https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/04/06/at-the-vanguard-paolo-sollier-italian-footballs-die-hard-left-winger-body-image-1491485640.jpg?resize=400:*, https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/04/06/at-the-vanguard-paolo-sollier-italian-footballs-die-hard-left-winger-body-image-1491485640.jpg?resize=600:* 2x'><source media='(max-width: 40.625em)' srcset='https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/04/06/at-the-vanguard-paolo-sollier-italian-footballs-die-hard-left-winger-body-image-1491485640.jpg?resize=650:*, https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/04/06/at-the-vanguard-paolo-sollier-italian-footballs-die-hard-left-winger-body-image-1491485640.jpg?resize=975:* 2x'><source media='(min-width: 40.625em)' srcset='https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/04/06/at-the-vanguard-paolo-sollier-italian-footballs-die-hard-left-winger-body-image-1491485640.jpg?resize=800:*'><img src='https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/04/06/at-the-vanguard-paolo-sollier-italian-footballs-die-hard-left-winger-body-image-1491485640.jpg' alt=''></picture><p class='article__image-caption'>Sollier (l) reading the Daily Worker // Image via <a href='https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paolo_Sollier#/media/File:Associazione_Calcio_Perugia_-_Paolo_Sollier_%2B_Giancarlo_Raffaeli.jpg' target='_blank'>Wikicommons</a></p></div><p>To comprehend the politics of Sollier's playing days, one has to first understand the climate in which he played his football. When he got the first big break of his senior career with a move to Serie D side Cossatese in 1969, Italy was on the brink of huge social upheaval and a polarisation of politics on both left and right. When Sollier joined Cossatese he was employed in the car industry, working in the Fiat Mirafiori factory in the south of Turin. Many of the factories and manufacturing plants of northern Italy were hotbeds of left-wing activity at the time, with the burgeoning trade union movement allied to well supported socialist and communist groups.</p><p>While Italy had experienced <i>Il Miracolo Economico </i>in the immediate post-war period, with an industrial and consumer boom raising living standards for many, the country was nonetheless plagued by enormous inequality and the usual social problems which come with rapid industrialisation and urbanisation. When <i>Il Miracolo Economico </i>turned to the <i>Anni di Piombo </i>('Years of Lead'), a period marked by widespread social unrest and an economic slowdown, cracks in the political status quo widened into a gaping maw. The vicious division between Italy's left and right had its roots in the Second World War, with the communist elements of the Italian resistance movement underpinning the Italian left and the remnants of the Mussolini regime buttressing the Italian right. There was little by way of common ground, mutual magnanimity and conciliation, and so Italians often found themselves having to keep their heads down or pick a side.</p><p>Not long after Sollier joined Cossatese, the <i>Autunno Caldo </i>(or 'Hot Autumn') began. This was a series of massive strikes in the industrial heartlands of the north, with workers vehemently calling for better pay and conditions. While this must have made for a febrile environment in which to play football, it was overshadowed by the events of the next decade. Most often perpetrated by the hardline Red Brigades on the left and various neo-fascist terrorist cells on the right, bombings, assassinations and kidnappings became commonplace in seventies Italy, with the <i>Anni di Piombo </i>claiming hundreds of lives.</p><p class='article__blockquote'><a href='https://sports.vice.com/en_uk/article/remembering-the-failed-serie-a-careers-of-arsenals-invincibles-generation'></a><b><a href='https://sports.vice.com/en_uk/article/remembering-the-failed-serie-a-careers-of-arsenals-invincibles-generation'>READ MORE: Remembering The Failed Serie A Careers of Arsenal's Invincibles Generation</a></b></p><p>In that sense, while Sollier may have found himself on what we would now consider to be the far left, his political stance was not as extreme as some of his contemporaries. In <i>Calci e Sputi e Colpi Di Testa</i>, he concedes that the Red Brigades were not a group he could get behind, and he has since harked back to the 1968 movement – a student campaign inspired by socialism, feminism and anti-establishment counterculture which preceded the <i>Autunno Caldo </i>– as a more significant form of left-wing struggle. Speaking about the movement in <a href='http://storiedicalcio.altervista.org/blog/paolo_sollier_chi_visto.html' target='_blank'>an interview with Stefano Boldrini</a>, he said: '[To some] it's as if the 1968 movement generated only those thousand idiots who took up arms and fired, and everything else can be forgotten. But 1968 has contributed to the social and civil progress of Italy. I think feminism, ecology, movements for civil rights: everything was born then. The main failure, if 'failure' is the right word for it, was the illusion that we could change the world. The world has not changed, but the 1968 movement made it a better place.'</p><p>The fact that Sollier refers to those who took up arms in the aftermath of the 1968 movement as 'those thousand idiots' suggests he was – while perhaps militant – not sympathetic to left-wing terrorism. That said, his views were still fairly uncompromising, and he made little effort to hide them from the crowds. Having raised his left fist through his career in the lower leagues, first with Cossatese and then with Pro Vercelli (where he moved in 1973) in Serie C, Sollier was faced with something of a dilemma when he was surprisingly snapped up by Perugia. Now playing professional football for a club in Serie B, a gesture which was intended to be appreciated by a handful of comrades suddenly had the potential to be rather more inflammatory. Speaking to Andrea Scanzi about his thought process at the time, Sollier said: 'The fist was natural. I did it in the lower leagues, in my early career, turning to my companions in the stands. When I arrived in Perugia I thought: 'Do I do it again, or do I stop?''</p><p>In the end, Sollier continued, and so his reputation began to snowball. Though he was by his own admission a fairly average footballer, he was also a hard working and tenacious midfielder who served Perugia remarkably well. In his first season with the club, they gained promotion to the top tier, Sollier chipping in with a smattering of goals along the way. He then helped them preserve their Serie A status the following season, after which he was unwillingly sold to Rimini where he continued his career in the second tier.</p><div class='article__media'><picture class='article__image'><source media='(max-width: 25em)' srcset='https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/04/06/at-the-vanguard-paolo-sollier-italian-footballs-die-hard-left-winger-body-image-1491485723.jpg?resize=400:*, https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/04/06/at-the-vanguard-paolo-sollier-italian-footballs-die-hard-left-winger-body-image-1491485723.jpg?resize=600:* 2x'><source media='(max-width: 40.625em)' srcset='https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/04/06/at-the-vanguard-paolo-sollier-italian-footballs-die-hard-left-winger-body-image-1491485723.jpg?resize=650:*, https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/04/06/at-the-vanguard-paolo-sollier-italian-footballs-die-hard-left-winger-body-image-1491485723.jpg?resize=975:* 2x'><source media='(min-width: 40.625em)' srcset='https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/04/06/at-the-vanguard-paolo-sollier-italian-footballs-die-hard-left-winger-body-image-1491485723.jpg?resize=800:*'><img src='https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/04/06/at-the-vanguard-paolo-sollier-italian-footballs-die-hard-left-winger-body-image-1491485723.jpg' alt=''></picture><p class='article__image-caption'>Sollier playing for Perugia in 1974 // Image via <a href='https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/it/8/8a/Serie_B_1974-75_-_Perugia_vs_Catanzaro_-_Paolo_Sollier.jpg' target='_blank'>Wikicommons</a></p></div><p>In a time when public figures were regularly being murdered for their political views, Sollier's decision to persevere with his pre-match communist salute was undeniably a brave one. Things did threaten to boil over ahead of one particular match against Lazio, when Sollier mischievously said that he was looking forward to 'beating Mussolini's team.' Unsurprisingly, this did not go down well among Lazio fans, some of whom brought a banner to the match which read 'Sollier to the Hangman'. Though seemingly unrepentant in his distaste for Lazio and their supporters, Sollier did admit in his interview with Scanzi: 'I was sorry about that. It was my fault, and some Perugia fans took a beating.'</p><p class='article__blockquote'><a href='https://sports.vice.com/en_uk/article/a-real-team-effort-when-football-squads-go-on-strike'></a><b><a href='https://sports.vice.com/en_uk/article/a-real-team-effort-when-football-squads-go-on-strike'>READ MORE: A Real Team Effort – When Footballers Go On Strike</a></b></p><p>Sollier also upset the footballing establishment with some of his comments in <i>Calci e Sputi e Colpi Di Testa</i>, in which he suggested that his fellow players were largely vacuous, politically unengaged and only interested in preserving their own privileged position. The book is in many ways a denunciation of conformity and apathy, and includes a disparaging assessment on the outlook of contemporary ultras, who Sollier saw as wasting their energies on matchday while remaining politically disengaged. Elements of the Italian press were scathing of Sollier in turn, with some mocking his more unconventional views, his insubordinate attitude and his unkempt appearance. Much like the 1968 movement itself, there was considerable debate among the public as to whether Sollier had political substance, or whether he had adopted a convincing pose which was really little more than a rebellious aesthetic rooted in a mop of long hair.</p><div class='article__media'><picture class='article__image'><source media='(max-width: 25em)' srcset='https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/04/06/at-the-vanguard-paolo-sollier-italian-footballs-die-hard-left-winger-body-image-1491485867.jpg?resize=400:*, https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/04/06/at-the-vanguard-paolo-sollier-italian-footballs-die-hard-left-winger-body-image-1491485867.jpg?resize=600:* 2x'><source media='(max-width: 40.625em)' srcset='https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/04/06/at-the-vanguard-paolo-sollier-italian-footballs-die-hard-left-winger-body-image-1491485867.jpg?resize=650:*, https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/04/06/at-the-vanguard-paolo-sollier-italian-footballs-die-hard-left-winger-body-image-1491485867.jpg?resize=975:* 2x'><source media='(min-width: 40.625em)' srcset='https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/04/06/at-the-vanguard-paolo-sollier-italian-footballs-die-hard-left-winger-body-image-1491485867.jpg?resize=800:*'><img src='https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2017/04/06/at-the-vanguard-paolo-sollier-italian-footballs-die-hard-left-winger-body-image-1491485867.jpg' alt=''></picture><p class='article__image-caption'>Sollier in action for Perugia against Parma // Image via <a href='https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Serie_B_1974-75_-_Perugia_vs_Parma_-_Paolo_Sollier_e_Luciano_Bertoni.jpg' target='_blank'>Wikicommons</a></p></div><p>In fairness to Sollier, little he has said or done in the interim suggests that his left-wing views were anything but sincerely held. Speaking about the censure he received at the time in a 2015 interview with Fabrizio Salvio in <i>SportWeek</i>, he said: 'the main criticism that I got was in relation to [how I could reconcile my left-wing politics with] my salary, but mine was the salary of a good employee. If I felt I was privileged it was for another reason, because I was doing the job of my dreams as a footballer. That is something fortunate that happens to only a few.'<br></p><p>It should be remembered that, despite his seventies leftist aesthetic, Sollier was a worker before he was a footballer. While there were no doubt some among the 1968 movement who were intellectual poseurs as opposed to genuine political thinkers, Sollier had shared the experiences of the northern working classes who made up the core support of the Italian left. It is telling that the subtitle to <i>Calci e Sputi e Colpi Di Testa </i>is <i>'</i><i>riflessioni autobiografiche di un calciatore per caso</i><i>'</i> (or 'autobiographical reflections of an accidental footballer'). Whatever one thinks of Sollier's political alignment, he clearly saw himself as a proletarian first and a footballer second.</p><p>Since he retired as a player in 1985, Sollier has written for various newspapers and coached a number of lower-league sides. <i>Calci e Sputi e Colpi Di Testa </i>was republished in 2008, bringing his exploits – now emblematic of a fascinating and turbulent period in Italian history – to the attention of a whole new generation. His continued commitment to left-wing causes, even now that <i>Avanguardia Operaia </i>and <i>Democrazia Proletaria </i>are long gone, has seen him retain much of his countercultural cachet and perhaps even reinforced his reputation as a rebel. Though he is little known outside of Italy, that no doubt suits him. In that 2013 interview with Scanzi, he claimed that – despite his social criticisms – he has never had an interest in converting people to his position. In the end, it all comes back to that closed fist. As Sollier added when further questioned on the definitive image of his career: 'It was a gesture turned inward, to myself. It was a reminder of who I was.'<br></p><p><a href='https://twitter.com/W_F_Magee' target='_blank'></a><b><i><a href='https://twitter.com/W_F_Magee' target='_blank'>@W_F_Magee</a></i></b></p>","Perugia, communist footballers, cossatese, Série B, avanguardia operaia, italian communism, democrazia proletaria, febrile situations, serie d, pro vercelli, serie a, Football, rimini, serie c, calci e sputi e colpi di testa, paolo sollier, communism, Italian football"
