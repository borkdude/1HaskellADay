What were the articles uploaded or updated today? How do we find that out?

We ... can determine this, given our current upload process: we look in the
logs. This, however, is not desireable: we simply want to answer a question
with no manual (parsing) intervention. The logs are good for telling us what
happened, but they aren't good for simple, automatic answers to questions, like
the one above.

So, let's solve this specific problem by introducing a packet pivot table. For
each packet of articles insert or updated, we join the article id with the
packet id. The packet ... 

BUT WAIT! The packet does not have a timestamp of when it was insert.

Thus the scope of today's Haskell exercise grows before our very eyes!
