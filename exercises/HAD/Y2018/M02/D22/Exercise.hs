P95 (**) English number words
On financial documents, like cheques, numbers must sometimes be written in full 
words. Example: 175 must be written as one-seven-five. Write a predicate 
full_words/1 to print (non-negative) integer numbers in full words.

fullWords :: Int -> String
fullWords n = undefined

{-- BONUS -----------------------------------------------------------------

Now, output the number in your native language... Finnish will be fun!

Note, the example above is NOT in English, so, if your native language is
English, output "one hundred seventy-five" not this "one-seven-five" weirdness.
--}

realWords :: Int -> String
realWords n = undefined

-- so your lexicon will be ... a 'bit' richer, eh?
