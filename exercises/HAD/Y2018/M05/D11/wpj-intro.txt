World Policy Journal is the flagship publication of the World Policy Institute. For 35 years, WPJ has been known for lively, intelligent writing that provides engaging, in-depth looks at global affairs and culture. We are not an academic journal (though we do publish scholars) and in commissioning pieces, we seek out reportage and analysis characterized by original thinking, compelling narratives, and stylish writing. We believe that good ideas can come from any field, and we think of policy as a point of entry into stories of broader interest. Writers should convey passion about their subjects and be able to humanize them, and readers should come away from articles with a sense of surprise and a deeper understanding of an issue’s history. We’re open to offbeat angles, and to new ways of understanding the world.

WPJ comes out four times a year—in March, June, September, and December—and each issue is loosely organized around a theme. Previous themes have included “Fascism Rising,” “Black Lives Matter Everywhere,” and “Renegade Cities.” Essays and reportage have engaged with issues of geopolitical and economic shifts, regional conflict, art, political controversy, immigration, exile, culture, and social change. Every issue features a range of voices from around the world, and regular features include a photojournalism portfolio, a Q&A with a compelling thinker, original illustrations, and short responses to one “big question.”
