                "text": "When actor Danny Glover was a youngster, he would listen to his parents talk about social injustice and ways to improve their world. They were postal workers, activists who labored on behalf of the union. Glover took the lesson to heart and, when necessary, has gladly taken the heat for his own efforts. Last month he was handed a $100 fine for trespassing at a Niagara Falls hotel, where he spoke in a 2006 rally on behalf of its workers. \"We went there to protest layoffs and penalties the workers were experiencing,\" Glover said, explaining that the owners were not honoring a union contract. Nothing new here. For most of his life, the star from all those \"Lethal Weapon\" films, \"Places in the Heart\" and \"Grand Canyon\" has been deeply involved in groups that aid underserved Americans and Africans. He has not shied from controversy. Glover's human-rights activism, reflected in his films as well as his life, has earned him the 2008 lifetime achievement award at the ONFilm Festival, sponsored by Old Dominion University with the city of Norfolk. It takes place Saturday through April 5. \"Man, world ain't supposed to work like this,\" Glover's character tells a terrorizing gang leader in \"Grand Canyon.\" Glover will be honored at 8 p.m. April 5 at Granby Theater in Norfolk. For $25, the public may attend the gala event. This year's film festival has an election-year-appropriate theme: \"Reel Politics.\" More than 30 films will be screened, primarily at ODU. Last week, Glover spoke by phone during a break from shooting new episodes for ABC's Emmy Award-winning, prime-time drama \"Brothers and Sisters.\" When asked about the festival award, he brushed away credit. \"It's not false humility. I don't have ownership of this, whatever this career is. It's a career whereby others have paved the way to make things happen.\" He was thinking of black actors such as Paul Robeson and Sidney Poitier - his role models - and countless others. \"A career is the embodiment of many struggles, not exclusively your own. People laid the groundwork, whether they were people who protested or demanded change or came before and set another standard. \"Where do I get the inspiration?\" he said, picking up steam in his mellow baritone - the same warm voice heard in so many compelling characters, from Moze, the itinerant laborer in 1984's \"Places in the Heart\" who taught Sally Field's character how to farm cotton, to Jake, the reclusive Vietnam vet of 2005's \"Missing in America\" who breaks out of his shell when a Vietnamese girl is left in his care. \"Where do I get the food? I get it from the human experience.\" From his childhood, Glover saw how working with other people toward a common goal created community. \"You are not a single person,\" he stressed. \"You have relationships.\" It's an awareness that seems at the center of his life. \"I learned what things were valuable. Ideas, ideals were valuable. My parents were that. That set a foundation for me. And when I was 13, 14, I saw young people who were not too much older than me marching and making change. All that stuff. \"It was enough to intrigue me. I wanted to emulate them.\" Glover, who is 61, was raised in the Haight-Ashbury section of San Francisco, where he still lives. He came up in a time of social ferment, in the 1960s. Hoping to make a difference, he studied economics at San Francisco State University then worked a decade for the city and county, specializing in housing and educational programs. Meanwhile, he took acting classes. His hobby quickly turned into a career when, in 1982, he made it to Broadway in South African playwright Athol Fugard's \"Master Harold. and the Boys,\" about apartheid. In Fugard's work he found \"a more human way of saying the same things I had performed as part of the more strident, agitprop theater in college,\" he told a Chicago reporter in 1987. \"Here was a real play with characters and not just positions.\" Film director Robert Benton saw him on Broadway and hired him for \"Places in the Heart.\" Glover's mother died the day he was cast. Not long before, she had prophesied that he would soon appear in an important film that would be about him. \"She was right,\" he told a reporter in 1992. \"This part of Moze was so much about me that it was beyond me.\" How so? \"His optimism.his ingratiating, often diplomatic way of dealing with the world.\" More important, Moze transcended his fears. \"He was still able to hold onto something that was more important: That we are our brother's keepers.\" Glover quickly became a celebrity, but has never lost his passion for public service. Among his many involvements: In 1998, he became the first goodwill ambassador for the United Nations Development Programme. Glover was focused on raising HIV/AIDS awareness in Africa, especially regarding children. He chairs the TransAfrica Forum, devoted to educating African Americans about the economic and political impact of American policies on Africa and advocating on behalf of that continent. He also is active in UNITE HERE, a North American union for hotel, restaurant and industrial workers. Glover still takes roles in mainstream movies, though his filmography is heavy on independents, often ones with socially redeeming messages. He's in two recent films - \"Be Kind Rewind,\" in which he plays the owner of a struggling video rental store, and \"Honeydripper,\" a John Sayles film set in 1950 Alabama, starring Glover as the owner of a floundering blues club. (The former is playing at Cinemark at Military Circle theater in Norfolk.) In 2005, he co-founded Louverture Films, which is devoted to producing films of historical relevance and social purpose. One of its projects, \"Trouble the Water,\" about post-Katrina New Orleans, won best documentary in January at the Sundance Film Festival. The company is named after Toussaint Louverture, who led a slave revolt in 1791 that freed Haiti from French rule. The colony became the world's first independent black republic. Glover has long wanted to direct a film about Louverture, and a film called \"Toussaint\" is listed on the company's Web site as \"in prep or development.\" A big chunk of funding for that project came last September, when Hugo Chavez, president of oil-rich Venezuela, announced that his government would give Glover's company about $18 million for that film, plus another couple million toward a movie about South American liberator Simon Bolivar, a native of Venezuela. Chavez, with his \"21st century socialism,\" is a hot button. The Bush administration watches warily for signs that he is evolving into another Fidel Castro, Chavez's friend and mentor, whereas some Americans, including Glover, admire his efforts to aid the underprivileged. Many Americans were offended that Chavez called President George W. Bush the \"devil\" in 2006 at the United Nations, and some noticed that Glover was by Chavez's side the next day in Harlem, as Chavez announced he would provide low-cost Venezuelan heating oil for people in that New York City neighborhood. Glover the protester has himself been the subject of protest. Last June, a Miami-based group of Venezuelan-American activists chided Democratic candidate John Edwards for campaigning with Glover, citing the actor's support of Chavez, reported The Miami Herald. Organizers of the Old Dominion University film festival said they do not expect any protests regarding Glover's appearance. \"I would welcome any discussion,\" said Austin Jersild, associate professor of history at ODU, who stressed that the scheduled films represent a wide range of viewpoints. Glover isn't bothered by the possibility of confrontations. \"They have the right to protest me, and they do that.\" He defended Chavez, calling him \"my friend,\" and reeled off what he sees as the good deeds of his populist government - improved health care and literacy, free universities, attempted land reforms. \"I have a right to talk to him if I want to. We're talking about the possibility of doing a film that no American company has touched in the past, or will touch in the future. They're not interested in doing that kind of film. \"I found someone who understands the relationship of the slave revolt to their own history. The slave revolts were the precursors to the independence movements in Latin America. \"It's about black people revolting against the empire. The slave revolting against the empire. Whenever the slave has revolted against the empire, the empire has hung them.\" Glover was thinking of Nat Turner and the white abolitionist, John Brown. \"Some people say I'm a tool for propaganda, but that's their preconception. If you want to challenge me, I'm willing to talk about it.\" Glover will be coming to Norfolk from Memphis, where he will have just taken part in the 40th anniversary commemoration of the assassination of Martin Luther King. Over the years, Glover has been pleased to have the chance to meet some of the movement's key figures - and to be another link in the continuum of their work. He sounded supremely moved whenever he touched on multiracial alliances, such as those he's witnessed through UNITE HERE. \"When I go into the bowels of a San Francisco hotel, I'm going to see Chinese workers and Filipino workers and African American and Latino workers. All these people. Remarkable. \"It's the real face of a multiracial country. I'm going to see that in action. It's a beautiful thing to see. \"And they understand that I'm there to give presence and notice to their work and to their issues. I love the words brother and sister. I love to play with calling them brother and sister. \"It makes me smile. I believe in my heart that that is the beloved community that King talked about.\" Teresa Annas,",

                "text": "Virginia Wesleyan's 15-3 softball start is its best since 1991. Pitchers Brittaney Brown, a Hickory product, and Ally Eates from Alliance Christian have been instrumental in the Marlins' surge. Brown, a sophomore, owns a 9-2 record, a 1.94 ERA and 78 strikeouts in 68 innings. Freshman Eates is 6-1 with an 0.68 ERA. Two of Wesleyan's leading hitters, outfielder Mandy Nixon and second baseman Kristy White, are former All-Tidewater performers - Nixon at Kempsville and White at Great Bridge. White, a senior, is hitting .500 with 16 RBIs, 10 extra base hits and a .750 slugging percentage. White, a sophomore, is hitting .362 average with 12 RBIs. - Freshman outfielder Maddi Ridenour has quickly established herself as an impact player at U.Va.-Wise. The leadoff hitter from Nansemond River earned Appalachian Athletic Conference Player of the Week honors after batting .500 with four runs and three stolen bases in six games. BASEBALL Trae Bailey had one of the most productive weeks in Christopher Newport history earlier this month. In a six-game stretch, the junior shortstop from Great Bridge hit .524 with 14 RBIs, eight runs scored, seven walks, five doubles, a triple and a home run. Through 20 games, Bailey is hitting .468, with 35 RBIs, an .831 slugging percentage and a .559 on-base percentage for CNU (16-4). - Ryan Breedlove, a Nansemond-Suffolk graduate, earned Old Dominion Athletic Conference Pitcher of the Week recognition on March 17. The Hampden-Sydney sophomore had a complete game win over Virginia Wesleyan and a save against Bridgewater. He allowed one earned run and struck out 11 in that 13-inning span. - Mary Washington is 15-4, with key contributions coming from former Greenbrier Christian stalwart Chase Townsend and Northampton grad Riley Gorman. The seniors are hitting .382 and .400, respectively. Towsend has 23 RBIs, while Gorman has 12 with four stolen bases. - Indian River alumnus Josh Hanes earned USA South Rookie of the Week honors for Greensboro after recording two hitless relief outings, including his second win over Hampden-Sydney. TRACK AND FIELD Norfolk State sophomore Marlon Woods set a school record in winning the long jump at the Wake Forest Open. The Booker T. Washington alumnus jumped 25 feet, 4.5 inches, an NCAA regional qualifying mark. He also qualified in the triple jump with a 49-3.5 effort that was good for sixth place. - Another Booker T. Washington grad, Bowie State freshman Elaine Rhoades, finished ninth in the triple jump at the NCAA Indoor Championships. She opened the outdoor season by winning the 400 hurdles at the Walker Invitational. - Kellam product Tristan Jordan finished second in the triple jump for the second consecutive year at the North Coast Athletic Conference Indoor Championships. He competes for the College of Wooster. OTHER SPORTS Kempsville graduates Esty Flores and Kendra Thomas were All-Conference Carolinas basketball selections at Barton College. Flores, a sophomore guard, made the first team with a 14.9 scoring average, 92 steals and 80 assists. Thomas, a junior, made the second team, averaging 13 points and 10 rebounds. - James Madison All-American field hockey goalkeeper Kelsey Cutchins from Lakeland and defender Jessie Dawson from Princess Anne made the NFHCA Division I National Academic Squad. - Kutztown freshman goalie Melissa Watson was named to the Division II team.

The first months of the invasion saw a young soldier named Jessica Lynch rescued, Baghdad toppled, and the unleashing of deadly bombings. 2002 Jan. 29 In his State of the Union address, President Bush tells Americans that \"our war against terror is only beginning\" and refers to \"an axis of evil\" consisting of Iran, Iraq and North Korea \"and their terrorist allies.\" Oct. 11 Joining with the U.S. House of Representatives, the U.S. Senate votes overwhelmingly to authorize the president to use force against Iraq. 2003 Jan. 27 Hans Blix, one of the chief United Nations weapons inspectors, delivers a negative report on Iraq's cooperation with two months of inspections, giving support to the Bush administration's campaign to disarm Iraq by force if necessary. Feb. 5 Secretary of State Colin Powell addressing the U.N. Security Council, presents photos, intercepts of conversations between Iraqi military officers, and information from defectors aimed at proving that Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein poses an imminent danger to the world. March 17 Powell declares that diplomatic efforts to end the crisis in Iraq are dead. Bush gives Saddam an ultimatum: Leave Iraq in 48 hours or face war. March 19 Saddam appears on Iraqi state TV and vows that Iraq will \"stand up to the evil invaders,\" who he says \"will face a bitter defeat.\" March 20 U.S. commanders begin the ground war with an assault by lead elements of Marine, Army and British forces. The attack was moved up after a cruise missile strike the previous night, ordered by Bush, that failed to kill Saddam. April 2 U.S. forces rescue Army Pfc. Jessica Lynch from a hospital in Nasiriya, where she'd been held captive since March 23. Lynch, 19, of Palestine, W.Va., was with the 507th Ordnance Maintenance Company. It was attacked after it took a wrong turn off a highway. April 5 An armored force of 60 U.S. tanks and other vehicles wheels into Baghdad, taking its defenders by surprise and starting a rolling firefight along boulevards lined with some people waving and others shooting. April 9 The Bush administration declares that the government in Baghdad has collapsed and U.S. forces have control of the city. A statue of Saddam is pulled down. May 1 Speaking from the deck of the aircraft carrier Abraham Lincoln in front of a banner reading \"Mission accomplished,\" Bush says that \"major combat operations in Iraq have ended,\" and that \"in the battle of Iraq, the United States and our allies have prevailed.\" June 15 Operation Desert Scorpion begins. The nationwide effort aims to hunt and capture Iraqis who have been attacking U.S. forces and to calm the civilian population with a flood of humanitarian aid. July 7 The White House acknowledges that Bush was relying on incomplete and perhaps inaccurate information from U.S. intelligence agencies when he declared, in his 2003 State of the Union speech, that Saddam had tried to buy uranium from Africa. Aug. 19 A bomber drives a cement mixer full of explosives into the side of the U.N. compound in Baghdad, killing 17 and wounding at least 100 in an attack on one of the principal agencies in charge of rebuilding Iraq. The dead include Sergio Vieira de Mello, top U.N. envoy in Iraq. Aug. 29 A car bomb explodes outside the Imam Ali Mosque in Najaf, the holiest Shiite shrine, killing at least 80 people. One of the dead is prominent Shiite cleric Ayatollah Muhammad Bakr al-Hakim. Sept. 7 President Bush says defeating terrorists in Iraq \"will take time and require sacrifice.\" He leaves open-ended how long U.S. troops will remain in Iraq and how much the conflict and occupation will ultimately cost. Oct. 27 Suicide bombers drive into five buildings around Baghdad, killing at least 34 people and wounding more than 200. The assault spreads mayhem in the city and appears to open a new phase in the guerrilla war against the U.S. occupation. Nov. 12 The Bush administration moves up its timetable for self-government in Iraq, deciding to try to hold elections in the first half of 2004 and turn civilian authority over to a temporary government before a new constitution is written. Dec. 13 Saddam Hussein is arrested without a fight by U.S. troops who find him crouching in an 8-foot hole at an isolated farm near Tikrit haggard, dirty and disoriented after eluding capture for nearly nine months. 2004 Jan. 23 David Kay, who led the U.S. effort to find banned weapons in Iraq, says he has concluded that Iraq had no stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons at the start of the war. March 31 Four Americans working for Blackwater USA, a security company based in Moyock, N.C., are ambushed and killed in Fallujah, and some Iraqis celebrate. A mob drags the men's burned bodies through the streets and hangs at least two of them from a bridge over the Euphrates River. April 5 U.S. troops raid Fallujah, using attack helicopters, tanks and warplanes against militants. April 28 U.S. soldiers at the Abu Ghraib prison outside Baghdad are accused of forcing prisoners into acts of sexual humiliation and other abuses in order to make them talk. The charges are documented by photos taken by guards. May 11 An Islamist Web site posts a videotape showing the decapitation of 26-year-old American contractor Nicholas Berg of West Chester, Pa., in Iraq. The killers call the beheading revenge for the U.S. mistreatment of Iraqi prisoners at Abu Ghraib. May 28 Dr. Iyad Allawi, a former Baath Party member who broke with Saddam, is named prime minister of the interim government due to take power on June 30. June 28 U.S. authorities turn over formal sovereignty of Iraq to its new leaders in a surprise ceremony called two days ahead of schedule. L. Paul Bremer III, administrator of the Coalition Provisional Authority, provides legal documents. July 9 The U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee says the most pivotal assessments used to justify the war against Iraq were unfounded and reflected major missteps by U.S. intelligence agencies. Sept. 7 The number of U.S. troops and Pentagon civilians killed in Iraq tops 1,000. 2005 Jan. 30 Defying death threats, mortars and suicide bombers, Iraqis turn out in great numbers to vote in Iraq's first free election in 50 years. Many show the ink on their fingers after voting. April 7 Shiite leader Ibrahim al-Jaafari is appointed Iraq's new prime minister, crystallizing the leadership of the first elected government in decades and ending more than two months of divisive negotiations. April 28 Almost three months after nationwide elections, Iraq's National Assembly votes overwhelmingly to approve a Shiite-led Cabinet, creating the first fully and freely elected government in Iraqi history. July 7 Al-Qaida in Iraq says it has killed Ihab El-Sherif, Egypt's ambassador-designate in Iraq. Oct. 15 Millions of Iraqis vote on a constitution. Oct. 19 Saddam Hussein and seven others go on trial in connection with the torture and killing of more than 140 men and boys in the Shiite town of Dujail, north of Baghdad. Oct. 25 Iraqi officials announce passage of a new constitution, paving the way for parliamentary elections. Dec. 15 Millions of Iraqis elect a parliament. 2006 Jan. 20 Results show, in part, that of 275 seats in the Council of Representatives, the United Iraqi Alliance wins 128 and Kurds 53. March 16 Iraq's parliament deadlocks on the positions of prime minister, president, speaker and Cabinet members. April 4 Saddam and Ali Hassan al-Majid, a former Iraqi general known as \"Chemical Ali,\" are charged with using poison gas to murder as many as 200,000 Kurds. April 22 Shiite politician Nouri al-Maliki is named prime minister. June 7 Al-Qaida's leader in Iraq, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, is killed in an airstrike. Afterward, the U.S. military displays a photo of the body in Baghdad. July 11 Citing $1 billion in questionable charges, the U.S. Army announces it will discontinue contract services with Halliburton, based in Houston. Nov. 5 Saddam, who had pleaded not guilty at his trial, is convicted in the 1982 killings of more than 140 people in Dujail and sentenced to hang. Nov. 23 Five car bombs and mortar attacks kill at least 138 people in Sadr City, a Shiite section of Baghdad. About 200 others are wounded. Dec. 6 The Iraq Study Group, led by former U.S. Secretary of State James Baker, reports that \"the situation in Iraq is grave and deteriorating.\" Dec. 21 Military prosecutors charge eight U.S. Marines in the deaths of 24 civilians in Haditha, Iraq, on Nov. 19, 2005. Dec. 30 Saddam is hanged. Video of his execution, apparently taken with a cell phone, winds up on the Internet. The former dictator was 69. 2007 Jan. 10 President Bush announces orders for dispatching 21,500 more troops to Iraq, a move dubbed the \"surge.\" Jan. 15 Saddam Hussein's half brother Barzan Ibrahim and Awad Hamed al-Bandar, former head of the Revolutionary Court, are hanged. They had been found guilty, along with Saddam, in the killing of more than 140 Shiite Muslims in the town of Dujail in 1982. Jan. 26 Gen. David H. Petraeus is unanimously confirmed by the United States as commanding general, Multi-National Force-Iraq. March 20 Former Iraqi Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan is executed for his role in killing residents of Dujail. He is hanged on the fourth anniversary of the U.S.-led invasion. May 1 Abu Ayyub al-Masri, leader of al-Qaida in Iraq, is reported to have been killed in a struggle within his own group, according to Iraqi authorities. Al-Qaida later disputes that he was killed, and U.S. authorities are unable to confirm his death. May 1 Bush vetoes a $124 billion war spending bill that includes a timetable for withdrawing U.S. troops. Sept. 10 Petraeus reports on Iraq to Congress, saying troops added to the war effort led to a \"dramatic decrease\" in al-Qaida attacks and reduced violence between Sunni and Shiite extremists. If progress continues, the U.S. force could return to \"pre-surge\" levels, about 130,000, by July '08. Sept. 16 Guards for Blackwater USA, a private security firm based in Moyock, N.C., fatally shoot 17 civilians in Nisour Square in Baghdad. In early reports, guards say they were under fire, but some eyewitnesses contradict the guards' accounts. Sept. 17 Iraq's government announces it plans to expel Blackwater from Iraq. Oct. 2 In testimony before Congress, Blackwater Chairman Erik Prince concedes that \"more can and should be done\" to increase oversight of armed security contractors in Iraq.

Feb. 15 The leading Republican presidential candidate, Sen. John McCain, defends his statement that U.S. troops could spend \"maybe 100\" years in Iraq. He tells CNN he was referring to a military presence similar to that in Japan, Germany and South Korea. Feb. 26 During a Democratic presidential debate in Texas, New York Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton criticizes Illinois Sen. Barack Obama's lack of experience in foreign policy and says their views on Iraq have been virtually identical. Obama counters that Clinton's vote in support of the war facilitated \"a decision that has been strategically damaging to the United States.\" Sources: The New York Times, CNN.com",

                "text": "THIRTY-TWO YEARS after Fred Duckworth's body was found sprawled beside a quiet Norfolk street, the manila folder in which detectives filed their notes on the case was 7 inches thick. Members of the department had spent collective years looking into the shooting. They had developed theories about motive. Had identified people with solid reason to wish the victim harm. Had the names of others who'd been passed along by informants. But theories were one thing; real leads were another. Legally speaking, the folder was stuffed with dead ends. Detectives new to the homicide squad would be handed the file to search for overlooked clues. They found none. Until Willie E. Creedle entered the picture. In 2004, Creedle told detectives visiting him in federal prison that an old friend of his, John S. Ozlin of South Hill, had talked of killing Duckworth a few years after the fact. The stories had unfurled, Creedle said, at a cabin that Ozlin's father kept in Palmer Springs, a settlement on the North Carolina line southwest of South Hill. The two met there to drink on numerous occasions. They'd known each other for years, though not well - Ozlin was just a year older but had graduated from high school four years before Creedle, in 1958. Youngest graduate, it was said, of any student in Park View High's history, at least until then. Their military backgrounds brought them together. Ozlin had been a Marine. Creedle had been in the Army. One night they were drinking in the cabin, and Ozlin started talking about this mayor he'd killed. Said he had been paid to do it. Said he shot the man after watching him make a phone call. Said he had to shoot more than once. Did it with a .22-caliber Ruger semiautomatic. Creedle said that Ozlin, who stood 6-foot-2, told him he'd pulled his jacket's hood up, and slipped a roll of toilet paper onto his head and under the hood to make himself appear taller. After the shooting, he'd tossed the gun off of a small bridge into a body of water. Ozlin was boasting about it, Creedle said. He brought it up on subsequent nights of drinking, as well. Always, the two were alone. Always, Ozlin raised the subject. When Creedle tried to bring it up, he said, Ozlin would turn silent and dark. One more thing: When Ozlin came back to South Hill from Hampton Roads, he was driving a new Porsche 911. Veteran investigators Glen Ford and Scott Mayer left Butner, N.C., mulling the story. It posed problems. One: The details of the crime were no secret. They'd been spelled out in newspaper articles many times. Number of shots, location of wounds, Duckworth's movements - it was all part of the public record. Some reports had included maps depicting two small bridges over fingers of the Lafayette River a few blocks from the scene. Creedle could be making the whole thing up. Or not: Ozlin could have been telling tall tales. That raised a second, bigger problem: Johnnie Ozlin was dead. He'd died in Richmond's MCV Hospitals in February 1991. He wasn't around to defend himself. Could neither confirm nor deny Creedle's account of his confession. Which brought up another worry - Creedle himself. For most of his life he'd been \"quite a wild buck,\" as a cousin of his put it. Had a respectable start: son to a well-regarded farmer and his schoolteacher wife in Union Level, west of South Hill; active in student government in high school, Future Farmers, 4-H; defensive lineman on the football team. Went to business college. Joined the Army in 1965. Married. Had two children. In 1971, Creedle left active duty and opened a business selling mobile homes in South Hill. As he told it, he was doing that when Duckworth was killed. Did it until 1974, when rising interest rates put him under. Re-entered the Army as a reservist in 1975. Went to jump school. Served as an interrogator. Got out for good in 1980. Afterward, would say little of his time in uniform. Concluded mention of it, years later, with: \"That's all I'm going to say. I'm serious as death.\" Maybe the service turned him rowdy. Whatever the case, in February 1981, he was indicted for discharging a firearm into an occupied vehicle. He was convicted. While he awaited sentencing in October 1982, he was arrested for killing a longtime acquaintance, one Franklin Delano \"Dilly\" Johnson. Witnesses testified that while drinking beer with several friends, Johnson had pulled a paper bag onto his head, like a hat, and dared Creedle to shoot it off. Creedle had done so with a .38-caliber Charter Arms revolver. Johnson had dared him to do it again. This time he pulled the bag down until its bottom rested on top of his skull. Creedle took up the dare. Johnson wound up with a hole beside his nose. A jury found Creedle guilty of manslaughter and sent him away for more than three years. On his release, he sold cars in Richmond. Then, in the early spring of 1990, he and his son, Garland Scott Creedle, sold a fully automatic Cobray M-10 pistol and silencer to a confidential informant of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. When the feds came to arrest the pair more than two years later, the Creedles fled to Honduras. Garland grew homesick, and he returned to Virginia and a prison term. His father bounced around Honduras, Guatemala and Belize. Opened a wholesale seafood business. Fathered four children by two women. Served as bodyguard to the rich. Became an honorary colonel in a local militia. Lived large. Twelve years passed before the authorities swooped in. Despite his past, detectives were not inclined to wave off Creedle. For one thing, Ozlin's name was not new to them. It was included on a list of \"persons of interest\" that had been put in the case file years before. The roster, evidently an attempt to index everyone who might have played a role in the killing, contained little beyond names. Most were well-known to anyone familiar with the case. Ozlin's was an exception. They had another reason to pay attention. Creedle had surprised them by announcing that he'd already provided his story to law enforcement. He'd given a statement to the Virginia State Police back in 1982 or 1983, while he was doing time for Dilly Johnson's death. Ford and Mayer checked out his story. The state troopers backed it up. Creedle had spoken with State Police Trooper Fred Clark while incarcerated. Clark had doubts about the tip - he noted that the prisoner had given him a journal in which he'd supposedly recorded Ozlin's remarks shortly after he made them; lab analysis had shown that the ink in said journal was just days old. Still, the trooper filed a report on the interview. Reading it, the Norfolk detectives understood that Creedle's story hadn't changed. What's more, they saw that the report had been forwarded to their own department. No mention of the document appeared in the case file. Over the years, in one culling or another, it had evidently been discarded or misplaced. That raised a question: Had Ozlin's name taken its place on the list of possible suspects because Creedle named him years before, or had Creedle corroborated information that detectives already had? Detective Ford sought out Ralph Mears, 16 years into the older man's retirement, only to find that the investigator once renowned for his photographic memory no longer had it. Mears couldn't recall much about Johnnie Ozlin. Mario Asaro wasn't much help, either. The only thing left to do was to start fresh on figuring out who this Ozlin was. What can be said for certain is this: John Ozlin's life began in Richmond in January 1942. He was the first of three children born to S.T. Ozlin Jr., a tire dealer and scion of a family prominent in Southside Virginia. One of S.T.'s uncles, Thomas W. Ozlin, was Virginia's speaker of the House. Another was a prominent lawyer and mayor of Chase City, one of Mecklenburg County's principal towns. A third spent more than 35 years as the agricultural agent in old Princess Anne County, today's Virginia Beach. Johnnie's family moved to South Hill, his father's home place, when he was 7. The Ozlins ran South Hill Tire and Recapping there, and within a couple of years moved into a big brick rancher just south of town. The furnishings were luxurious. Johnnie wanted for nothing. Some considered him spoiled. After high school, he worked for his father at the tire store. Joined the Marines Reserve in 1962. Sold liquor at an ABC store for a while. Lived in Richmond in 1964 and 1965, working for a tire outfit and living with several guys from South Hill. One facet of his personality became plain: He was wild and reckless when drunk. One longtime friend, C.H. \"Penny\" Bracey, would later describe him as a \"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,\" somebody who \"could run for governor and win\" when sober, but who turned mean with drink. \"He was a hell-raiser to start with - no ifs, ands or buts,\" Bracey recalled. \"He enjoyed fighting.\" Ozlin joined the Marines in 1965. Was stationed on Okinawa. By his telling, went to Vietnam on at least two occasions. Honorably discharged in 1967, he returned to South Hill before moving again, to Virginia Beach. Ample evidence exists that Ozlin was present in the area when Duckworth was killed. The Virginia Beach city directories for 1971 and 1972 list him as manager of a Super Tire Stores outlet at 1948 Diamond Springs Road. Old friends describe his renting a place just off Shore Drive with another South Hill man, now dead. Ozlin is said to have packed a gun at all times. To have used it once after a drunken argument with his roommate: While the other man was upstairs in the shower, Ozlin reportedly fired a round from the room below. He only just missed. He terrified some of his co-workers at the tire place. At least one took to carrying a gun himself. Ozlin reportedly cultivated some very unsavory friends in Hampton Roads. Mobsters, his acquaintances called them. Mafia, is how Creedle put it. The detectives found documentation that Ozlin bounced between Hampton Roads and Mecklenburg County through much of 1973: A ticket for defective equipment in South Hill on Jan. 19. A reckless driving charge in the 1300 block of Military Highway on March 31. A court appearance and conviction on that charge in late May. An incident where no charges were filed, in which he shot a friend in the stomach in South Hill. Most memorably, the detectives found that Ozlin had burned down the unoccupied Truckers Rest and Relaxation Massage Parlor, located alongside I-85 in Bracey, Va., in the early morning hours of Aug. 15, 1973. The crime followed a melee at the massage parlor the previous night, and another disturbance the night before that; Ozlin was central to both. He served 90 days before his \"perfect prison record\" earned him parole, in June 1974. Back in South Hill, he helped manage his father's tire store. Attracted notice driving around town in his 1973 Porsche - detectives were able to confirm that detail, too. Ozlin destroyed the car and was badly injured in a accident just outside South Hill. Wound up in the hospital. Drank in earnest. He ran into more trouble >in July 1977, when he was named in a two-count federal indictment for receiving and possessing a rifle and pistol, a criminal act for a felon. Served just under six months of a two-year sentence. The rest of the trail revealed a steady, sad decline. Two DUIs within days of each other in 1988. Jail on one of the charges. Liver trouble. By the time he died, he had swelled up to twice his normal size. Lifelong friends could barely recognize him. Did Johnnie Ozlin pull the trigger? Detectives can't say. Some of the people they interviewed in South Hill, people who knew Ozlin all his life, said flat-out that they didn't believe it. Indeed, any evidence suggesting his involvement is second-hand or circumstantial. Enough to start an inquiry, perhaps. Not enough to wrap one up. Police have not established a definite link between Ozlin and anyone identified as having a motive to kill Duckworth. Mears and Asaro never linked those with a motive to the commission of the crime. Thirty-five years after the fact, the case is at an impasse. About the only hope for cracking it lies in someone stepping forward with new information. New evidence. A small, seemingly insignificant detail that ties everything together. It could happen. Ralph Mears has seen it, himself. He worked the case of a woman whose body was found half-buried off Northampton Boulevard in August 1984. She'd been married to a big Army sergeant. Mears was certain he'd killed her. Nearly 18 months later, an ex-sailor living in Massachusetts drove to Norfolk, walked into police headquarters and confessed. He'd been stationed here in 1984. Said he forced the woman into his car, raped her and killed her. Also confessed to raping and killing a Norfolk middle-schooler, and raping a third woman, and beating a sleeping man with a hammer. So you never know. Maybe one of these days, someone who's nearing the end will want to unburden his or her conscience. The police have their evidence ready, should that day come. They kept the clothes Duckworth wore. The seven shell casings found on Major Avenue. The bullets extracted from his body. Another trinket of Fred Duckworth's last night can still be found across town. When his widow, Gertrude, died, the family donated the mayor's papers and mementos to Old Dominion University. Scrapbooks detailing his career at Ford and City Hall. Clippings about his death. His gavel. His Shriner fez. They're all stored in the school's library. And, in one box, alongside his pocket knife and tie tacks, is his stainless steel pedometer. Presumably, the one he was wearing when he died. Its hand remains stopped just shy of five miles.",

                "text": "By STEVE STONE, LINDA McNATTAND DAVE FORSTER SOUTHAMPTON COUNTY Three Boy Scouts and one of their troop leaders died in a fiery wreck Sunday after the sport utility vehicle they were in ran off a road and struck a tree. All of the victims were affiliated with Troop 17 of Franklin and were returning home from a weekend scouting event in Blackstone, a city about 75 miles northwest of Franklin. Sgt. D.S. Carr, a State Police spokesman, said a fourth Scout, the driver's son, managed to pull himself from the burning vehicle and is hospitalized. \"This is just such a tragic loss,\" said Carr, who was at the scene of the crash on the edge of Sebrell, a small community of a few dozen homes in Southampton County. The driver of the 2002 Chevrolet was identified as Assistant Scoutmaster John Oliver, 43, of the 100 block of Rawlsdale Drive in Franklin. Oliver was an 18-year Marine Corps veteran and a survivor of the 1983 bombing of a U.S. military compound in Beirut, Lebanon. It was his son, Michael John Oliver, 12, who escaped. The boy was flown from the crash to Sentara Norfolk General Hospital, where he was being treated for broken bones and other injuries but was listed in good condition Sunday, State Police Sgt. Greg Jackson said. The three boys who died were Luke Drewry, 12, of Franklin; Jackson Fox, 13, of the 24000 block of Orchard Lane in Capron; and Carter Thomas Stephenson, 14, of the 100 block of Park Circle in Franklin. A street address was not available for Drewry. \"They were outstanding in scouting,\" said Phillip Bradshaw, a Scout leader in Carrsville who said he knew all of the boys and Oliver. \"It's really a sad, sad thing,\" said Bradshaw, who had just returned from a camping trip to Manassas with his own troop over the weekend. The four Scouts and Oliver were heading home from a Methodist scouting event in Blackstone, said Amanda Wroten, a spokeswoman for the Colonial Virginia Council of the Boy Scouts of America, of which Troop 17 is a member. \"We are concerned for the families of the Scouts and for the scouting family as a whole, and that's what we are focus ing on right now,\" Wroten said Sunday evening. \"Scouting is one big family.\" The council's executive director, Dick Collins, went to Franklin on Sunday afternoon to meet with the troop's leadership and some of the families, Wroten said. \"We're going to try and make grief counseling available for anyone who needs it,\" Wroten said. \"And if there is anything else they need, we'll try to help.\" News of the deaths swept quickly through Franklin, where a service of support was held at 5 p.m. at Franklin Baptist Church. \"The whole community of Franklin is devastated by this event,\" said Susan Powell, a friend of Carter Stephenson's family. \"We knew Carter through the community and through our church,\" said Powell, whose husband is also involved in scouting. Carter, a Franklin High School freshman, \"was a wonderful, kind, endearing boy,\" she said, \"always eager to help, to be involved. He was a wonderful, fun child.\" He needed only two more merit badges to earn scouting's highest rank, Eagle Scout. Dora Gurganus, of Southampton County, a friend of the Fox family, was at their home Sunday night. She said it speaks volumes for all of the boys that they were good Scouts, good students and hard workers. \"This was a horrible accident, a loss to everybody in the community,\" Gurganus said. \"Jackson was just living life to the fullest. He was dedicated to his church. A good student, a good boy.\" Jackson was a student at Southampton Academy. He had one brother. Gurganus said the boy's family is one of the most respected farm families in Southampton. Lynn Rothwell said his son-in-law, John Oliver, was a native of Lorraine, Ohio, who, after his marriage to a Franklin woman, came to the city to raise his family and work with children. Even though he was left with a disability after the Beirut explosion more than 20 years ago, Oliver was able to coach baseball and soccer, Rothwell said. He was very involved with scouting. A person who answered the phone at the Drewry home Sunday night said the family preferred to not make a statement. Carr said the single-vehicle wreck occurred at 12:10 p.m. on Va. 35, or Plank Road, near its intersection with Barn Tavern Road in northern Southampton County. The SUV was the second of two vehicles carrying 10 boys home from their weekend outing. The crash remains under investigation. \"We don't know why it happened,\" Carr said. \"There's a lot of possibilities.\" Carr said all the bodies were sent to the State Medical Examiner's office in Norfolk to determine the cause of death . In the case of the driver, he said, any possibilities of a medical condition or other contributing factors would be checked. \"Hopefully, with the son, if he was cognitive of what was going on, he can give us a statement of what he remembers happening prior to the crash,\" Carr said. The area where the wreck occurred is posted for a speed limit of 55 mph, and Carr said there was no evidence that excessive speed was involved. The SUV had just gone through the first of two curves when it ran off the road, Carr said. The first is posted with a sign alerting drivers to the turn. The second, slighter turn is not posted, he said. There was no evidence of tire marks to indicate that the driver tried to get back onto the pavement once the SUV ran off the left side of the road, Carr said. \"It pretty much went straight off the curve and right into the tree,\" Carr said. The other adult in the group, driving the first vehicle, witnessed the wreck. She happened to look into her rear view mirror just at the moment of the crash, Carr said. \"She said it basically exploded when she saw it. It was very traumatic for her,\" he said. The woman, whose name was not released, immediately stopped and turned around, Carr said. Several nearby residents scrambled out to help, Carr said. But in just the few moments it took for them to get to the SUV, the eruption of flames made rescue impossible. \"By the time they got to it, there was nothing they could do,\" Carr said. They called for help and tended to the sole survivor. The boys were among more than 1,200 youths from the Boy Scouts and the Girl Scouts attending a three-day Virginia United Methodist Scouting Fellowship. The annual event, hosted for more than 20 years by the United Methodist Men, is held at the Virginia Methodist Conference Center in Blackstone. \"The whole scouting community is going to be shocked in the morning, I know,\" said Dave Wilkinson, an assistant Scoutmaster who has led a Blackstone troop since 1988. Wilkinson said taking Scouts to such events always carries a hefty measure of concern. \"It's like my biggest fear,\" he said, \"bringing everybody home safe.\" On the road, he said, \"you're 10 times more careful than you would be any other time, if not 100.\" Troop 17 is the oldest and largest in Franklin, headquartered at High Street United Methodist Church. It's part of the Colonial Council, which serves 10,000 Scouts in Emporia, Franklin, Hampton, Newport News, Poquoson, Smithfield, Suffolk, and Williamsburg as well as the counties of Brunswick, Gloucester, Greensville, Isle of Wight, James City, Mathews, Surry, Sussex, Southampton, and York.

                "text": "Joe Gibbs the NFL coach is quick to say that the past buys a football team nothing, that what happened yesterday has no bearing on what's happening today. But that's not the standard Joe Gibbs the team president uses when addressing some of the personnel decisions he has overseen since rejoining the Washington Redskins. Any discussion of the inadequacies of recent free-agent pickups Adam Archuleta, Andre Carter, Kenny Wright, Tyson Walter, Christian Fauria and others are prefaced by Gibbs saying he doesn't know where the team would be without Marcus Washington, Cornelius Griffin, Phillip Daniels, Shawn Springs. While all four play integral roles on the team and were wise acquisitions, they're all also members of the Class of 2004. This is 2006. An examination of Gibbs' front-office record shows diminishing returns that suggest he needs help, but Gibbs says that won't happen. He retooled the scouting department last offseason. He defends the work of team vice-president Vinny Cerrato, who oversees all aspects of player personnel. It's hard to find an NFL team with less interest in the draft than the Redskins. Since Gibbs returned, the Redskins have traded 11 picks and made 16 selections. Nine remain on the roster, but only three are starters: tight end Chris Cooley, safety Sean Taylor and cornerback Carlos Rogers. The dealt choices that stick out are the second-rounder in 2004 that was packaged with star cornerback Champ Bailey to pry running back Clinton Portis from Denver; the third-rounder that same year that went to Jacksonville for Mark Brunell; and the equivalent of a high-third-round choice to Atlanta for back T.J. Duckett. It was no secret that Bailey wasn't returning to the Redskins, so coming away with Portis was making the best of a bad situation. But the player the Broncos took with Washington's pick, Tatum Bell, is the AFC's leading rusher. As for Brunell, there were indications that the Jaguars were going to release the then-33-year-old quarterback before the deal was made. Duckett, who came in after Portis and Ladell Betts were injured in preseason, has five carries all season and as a free agent after this season, could be elsewhere next year. Trades that netted Santana Moss (for Laveranues Coles) and tight end Chris Cooley (with New Orleans for a third-rounder) have benefited the team. As for front-office decisions on free agents, the two that hurt the most were allowing linebacker Antonio Pierce to leave before the 2005 season and failing to go after safety Ryan Clark after last season. Pierce is playing at a near-Pro Bowl level for the Giants. The Redskins received a decent season from Lemar Marshall in '05, but he's fallen way off this year. Keeping Pierce would've let the Redskins play Marshall on the outside, where the former safety is better suited. Clark's value exceeded anything he did on the field. He was a leader in the locker room, a popular player and a guiding influence for Taylor. And he would've been far less expensive to keep than Archuleta, who signed a seven-year, $35-million deal that was the largest ever for a safety. Archuleta leads the team in tackles, but few of them have been at the line of scrimmage or \"in the box,\" as was envisioned. And his coverage skills have been so lacking that the Redskins brought in veteran Troy Vincent last week and immediately began working him into the lineup. Carter, though a tireless worker, has put virtually no pressure on the quarterback. Wright has regularly been beaten in coverage and is a poor tackler. Fauria replaced departed free agent Robert Royal and has not been an improvement. Walter, a guard, was waived last week. Meanwhile, here are some starters or valued backups the Redskins could have had if they had retained their choices: From 2004: S Bob Sanders (second round to Colts); S Madieu Williams (second round to Bengals); tackle Max Starks (third round to Steelers); QB Matt Schaub (third round to Falcons); CBs Nathan Vasher and Jason David (fourth round to Bears and Colts); WR Jerricho Cotchery (fourth round to Jets); From 2005: LB Lofa Tatupu (second round to Seahawks); CB Dominique Foxworth (third round to Denver); DE Chris Canty (third round to Cowboys) From 2006: C Nick Mangold (first round to Jets); DT Barry Cofield (fourth round to Giants).

                "text": "By larry bonko THIS JUST IN. If pro football great Emmitt Smith emerges the victor on ABC's third edition of \"Dancing With the Stars,\" give some credit to the Evelyn Ott School of Dance in Norfolk. Smith and partner Cheryl Burke polished their routines for several days at the Ott studio on Harold Street. The school, in its 66th year, also has a studio in Chesapeake. Smith, who with Troy Aikman and Michael Irvin led the Dallas Cowboys to victory in three Super Bowls in the 1990s, isn't from around here, but he has a strong local connection. His wife of six years, the former Patricia Southall, hails from Chesapeake. She was previously married to actor/comic Martin Lawrence. Last month, when Southall served as mistress of ceremonies for the 2007 Miss USA-Virginia pageant in Norfolk - she won the title in 1993 - Smith accompanied her to Hampton Roads. Not one to waste time, Smith used the visit to rehearse for his appearance on \"Dancing With the Stars.\" The show airs at 8 p.m. Tuesdays and Wednesdays on WVEC. He's quite the dancer, said the school's director, Denise Ott Land, and a nice guy to boot. At the Ott studio, Smith and Burke worked on the number - Robert Palmer's \"Simply Irresistible\" - that they performed as a tango on the Sept. 26 show. \"For a football player, Emmitt moves quite well on the dance floor,\" Land said. \"We didn't charge ABC for the use of our facilities. Instead of asking for a fee, I mentioned to Smith that we'd appreciate it if he said nice things about us should he win.\" Smith so far has excelled in the samba, tango and jive on a show that features celebs not known for their terpsichorean gifts. Whoever thought you'd see the guy who rushed for 18,000-plus yards in the NFL doing the paso doble on television with 20.1 million people watching? WVEC's Janet Roach broke the story of Smith's visit. Roach and her co-anchor on \"13 News Daybreak,\" LaSalle Blanks, have been asking viewers to vote for Smith to keep him dancing. \"We're not Dallas Cowboys fans,\" said Blanks, \"but we launched the 'save Emmitt' campaign because he trained in Hampton Roads.\" A virus on the loose I'm sorry to report that television continues to spread a phrase that has infected our language for more than a decade - \"like, I mean, you know.\" Mum's the word If The New York Times Co. is close to selling its nine television stations, including WTKR in Norfolk, no one at Goldman, Sachs and Co. is ready to talk about it. When the Times Co. put the stations on the block Sept. 12, Goldman, Sachs and Co. was contracted to give advice and counsel on the sale. The process of matching the seller to potential buyers is under way, said a Goldman spokesman. That's all he said. Might a Virginia Beach company, Max Media, which already owns nine television stations in five states (and 37 radio stations in 10 states), make a bid? Not likely, said John Trinder, president of Max Media. \"I don't see us bidding on that package.\" It's been estimated by The Wall Street Journal that The Times Co. stations could bring $500 million. Obscure fact of the week The actors who appear on \"The Office,\" the offbeat NBC comedy set in the Dunder Mifflin Paper Co. in Scranton, Pa., have yet to visit that city in northeastern Pennsylvania, an area where your humble columnist was born and reared. The show is produced in Southern California. Snack time Wanda Sykes, the Portsmouth native who's a regular on the CBS sitcom \"The New Adventures of Old Christine,\" is also in the cast of \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\" on HBO. She prefers the working conditions on the CBS show, she said in a telephone interview earlier this month. \"I have a better parking space at the studio where we shoot 'Old Christine.' The food on the craft services table is also much better.\" Violins up WHRO-FM (90.3) begins another season of Virginia Symphony Orchestra concerts. This season's first is at 9 p.m. Wednesday. They'll continue on the first Wednesday of the month through summer with two exceptions, \"The Messiah\" is scheduled for Dec. 20, and \"The Hollywood Score\" will be heard Feb. 28. Also on WHRO-FM, the next \"Opera Insight Previews,\" hosted by Lane Dare, airs Saturday and Nov. 11 at 1 p.m. It deals with the Virginia Opera production of Carlisle Floyd's \"Susannah.\" Bedtime, kids Jennifer Pulley, who left WWDE-FM (101.3) after the station dropped her \"Breakfast Bunch\" for the syndicated Whoopi Goldberg show, said she'd like to get back into television. Pulley was once a star on the rise at WTKR. \"My future is pending,\" she said. Until TV or radio again beckons, she'll be a full-time mom to her children, ages 5 and 7 months. Ouch! That hurts After the hoopla that ushered in the Katie Couric era at \"The CBS Evening News,\" her broadcast has slipped to fourth at 6:30 p.m. in Hampton Roads with a 3.7 household rating. Beating her soundly is \"Judge Judy\" (7.5) on WGNT. What size boot does he take? WVEC reporter Craig Civale, he of the chiseled jaw, heads for Dallas soon to join his former news director, Michael Valentine, at WFAA. Civale, who did solid reporting for Channel 13 in his 4-1/2 years here, proposed to his wife, former reporter Michelle Louie, on the station's early-morning newscast in 2003. Closing note Several readers have called or written to ask where they can see \"The Grand Ole Opry,\" which recently celebrated its 81st birthday. CMT dropped the show in 2003, after which it was picked up by Great American Country, a channel not available on cable hereabouts. The DISH network beams it in by satellite, however. Sirius satellite radio has \"Grand Ole Opry Weekend.\" You can also connect on the Internet at . Enjoy. Reach Larry Bonko at or",

But what coach Jeff Beard calls \"the perfect play\" went awry, and Western Branch took a 52-49 victory in five overtimes. The Hawks went for it on fourth-and-goal from the 2. \"We hadn't stopped them all night long in overtime,\" Beard said. \"Our players were tired and dinged up. From the 2-yard line, that's about as good as you're going to get. We kick a field goal, and we go through all this stuff again. We were going for the win - we weren't going to prolong it any longer.\" Josh Bonney tackled Hawks quarterback Brian Inghram at the 1 on the final play, keeping Western Branch's playoff hopes alive and burying those of Hickory. \"We called timeout and knew exactly what play we wanted to run,\" Beard said. \"Everything was perfect. \"We knew exactly where they were going to align. We missed two blocks, and that's the difference between winning and losing. We make those two blocks, and we win the football game.\" Western Branch and Hickory each scored TDs during the first four overtimes. Bryan Barnson's 23-yard field goal was the difference. \"When you win with heart like that, it's gotta say a lot for your team,\" said Western Branch coach Lew Johnston, who is retiring after this season. \"Hopefully we can carry it on to this week and beyond.\" Western Branch hosts Indian River on Friday in Johnston's last home game. Oscar Smith likely to keep Sims at QB for now Freshman Phillip Sims figures to remain Oscar Smith's starting quarterback Friday against King's Fork as senior Dexter Merritt continues to recover from a knee injury. Merritt, who has missed the past three games, could be cleared to practice after a doctor visit today. But coach Richard Morgan said Merritt's return won't be rushed. \"If he's given the green light, I'm going to ease him back in this week,\" Morgan said. \"We'll let him get back in there and test it out on the field. I'd probably ease him back in in practice first and not in a game.\" Sims has thrown for 533 yards and 10 touchdowns - with no interceptions - in his three starts. He threw four TD passes in last week's 35-0 victory over previously unbeaten Deep Creek. Afterward, Sims said he would \"take my role as a backup\" when Merritt returns. Churchland's Kello should be ready to go Churchland coach Martin Asprey said Friday's injury to leading rusher Anthony Kello is \"nothing serious.\" Kello suffered a deep arm bruise in the third quarter against Norcom and didn't return. The Truckers have a bye this week, and Asprey said Kello likely will return for the Nov. 3 game at Lake Taylor. Kello, a senior running back, has rushed 759 yards and six touchdowns. The Truckers (4-4, 4-1 Eastern District) have won three in a row and are one victory from matching their best finish since going 8-2 in 1997. \"We're minimizing mistakes,\" Asprey said. \"I think the first three weeks we turned the ball over three to four times a game, and you can't do that and win.\" Coach says Kelley will be Maury's QB this week Maury backup quarterback Lorenzo Branche completed 4 of 14 passes for 102 yards and a TD to help the Commodores to a 21-12 victory over Booker T. Washington last week. But the big question after the game was: Where was starter Stephen Kelley? Commodores coach Dealton Cotton said Kelley not starting was a \"coach's decision.\" Cotton didn't elaborate, but he did say Kelley will be back behind center when Maury plays at Norview on Saturday. Big tests coming up for Norview back Fields Norview's Marquez Fields became the first South Hampton Roads player to surpass 1,000 rushing yards this season when he gained 168 yards on Friday against Granby. He has 1,137 this season. Fields, 5-foot-6 and 155 pounds, is just the second Pilots running back in the last 10 years to surpass 1,000 yards in a season. In 2004, Stacey Respass rushed for 1,126 yards. Former Norview running back and current Booker T. Washington coach Larry Stepney holds the school record of 1,604 yards. Fields has rushed for more than 100 yards in every game this season, with his best being 183 against Wilson. Fields will be challenged to continue that against Maury and Lake Taylor. Maury's defense ranks fourth in South Hampton, and Lake Taylor's defense ranks No. 1. \"I don't think we've allowed anybody over 100 yards except for the first game,\" said Maury coach Dealton Cotton, referring to Phoebus' Dennis Mathis, who got 209 yards. \"We all want to step up to the challenge and see what we can do against a good offensive team like that.\" Norview's line clearing the path for Fields Norview coach Robert Toran credits his offensive line with helping Marquez Fields become South Hampton Roads' top rusher. Toran said the right side of his line - Klinton Ruff and Zachery Chavis - has been particularly impressive. Ruff is the anchor. At 6-4 and 290 pounds, he can run 4.9 in the 40. Toran said that athleticism has helped Ruff earn a lot of attention lately, including an offer from Virginia. Chavis is 5-10 and 230 pounds but just as explosive. Bayside getting its running game in gear Bayside is averaging 320 yards of total offense per game with quarterback E.J. Manuel passing for 1,503 yards and 12 TDs this season. But the Marlins are averaging 105 yards rushing per game. Coach Darnell Moore's running attack got a big lift last week with the return of Raphael Bazemore from a high ankle sprain. Against Ocean Lakes on Friday, Bazemore broke a 75-yard touchdown run. \"I was telling another coach last week that I saw him do some things that he hasn't done since the first week of the season,\" Moore said. \"I could see he was ready. He proved me right.\" Moving up the charts. Kempsville Kevin Simmons and Salem's Kevin Whaley this week should both surpass 1,000 rushing yards for the third straight season. And Great Bridge's Casey Turner is nearing a second straight 2,000-yard passing season. Simmons' 3,791 career yards rank fifth all-time behind Cox's Lamont Still (3,913 yards). Simmons, a senior, is tied for seventh with Wilson's Robert \"Ton\" Davis on South Hampton Roads' career scoring list with 276 points. Simmons has 992 yards and 12 TDs this season. Whaley is closing in on the top 10 for career yardage. Whaley, a junior, has 3,443 yards and 250 career points. He has rushed for 968 yards and scored 20 TDs this year. Turner, a junior, ranks sixth on South Hampton Roads' career yardage list with 4,536. Turner has thrown for 1,802 yards and 15 touchdowns this season. - Compiled by Jami Frankenberry and Larry Rubama",

Kim Berger had knocked in a Jessica Michaels assist to give Tallwood a 1-0 lead early in the second half. Kellam tied the match about 10 minutes later when Julia Garrison sent in Kendall Lam's pass. Tallwood will face top-seeded and No. 1-ranked Cox in a 3 p.m. semifinal at the National Training Center. Ocean Lakes will play Princess Anne in the other 3 p.m. semifinal. Cox has already secured a berth to Tuesday's Eastern Region quarterfinals. So, should Cox win Thursday, the Ocean Lakes-Princess Anne winner will earn the Beach's other region berth. Cox 3, Bayside 0: Despite 11 first-half penalty corners, the Falcons failed to score until early in the second half. Kiley Allosso scored the eventual winner on a pass by Danielle Scissom. Scissom assisted Stephanie Fee several minutes later, and Kaitlyn Hiltz scored near the end of the match to keep her scoring streak alive at 15 consecutive games. Princess Anne 4, Salem 0: The second-ranked Cavaliers took a 3-0 first half lead on goals by Katie Price, Torrie Jackson and Chelsea Hill. Jackson added another goal seven minutes into the second half. Ocean Lakes 4, First Colonial 0: Kay Tufts broke a scoreless tie with less than a minute to play in the first half. The Dolphins controlled the second half, getting a goal from Marjorie Pettitt and two by Jenna Lowery. GIRLS VOLLEYBALL Ocean Lakes 3, Kellam 2: Kelsey Bounds and Susan MacClary combined for 26 kills, and Lindsey Spears had 10 blocks as the No. 3 Dolphins (13-4, 9-0) upended the No. 2 Knights (14-4, 7-2) to take sole possession of first in the Beach District. Ocean Lakes can clinch the district with a victory in the regular-season final Thursday at Cox. Princess Anne 3, Cox 2: Suzanne Leseigne made 17 kills and was 33 for 33 serving, and Erin Holben had 23 digs as the No. 4 Cavaliers (14-5, 7-2 Beach) stopped the No. 1 Falcons (17-2, 8-1). GIRLS CROSS COUNTRY State Catholic Schools meet: Bishop Sullivan's Taryn Schrader paced the girls with a 19:38 clocking at Newport News. Paul VI won the team title with 23 points. Bishop Sullivan finished fifth. BOYS SOCCER TCIS quarterfinals Norfolk Academy 8, Peninsula Catholic 0: Jordan Cyrus had a goal and four assists and T.J. Cyrus added two goals to lead the No. 1 seed.

                "text": "Pop-culture-film-classic-quoPop culture film classic, \"The Outsiders,\" inspired the designs Justin Timberlake and Trace Ayala. Would Pony Boy and Cherry be proud? By Eric Wilson, New York Times Service \"Mmm, sexy,\" the voice of Justin Timberlake answered, his words echoing. \"It's not the clothes. It's the way you wear them. Sexy is a state of mind. It's about that attitude, attitude, attitude.\" Timberlake, in the flesh, was sitting dead still on top of a speaker box while the previously recorded interview played on, his silver argyle Vans splayed apart and his head hung low under a slim black hoodie. He sat that way for several minutes, a pop buddha preaching the dharma of bringing \"SexyBack,\" motionless as people moved lights all around him and B-boy dancers polished the floor with their chests. Then in a blink, he was sitting next to a reporter on a bleacher with his arm on his shoulder. \"I'm stressed,\" Timberlake said. \"How was your flight? When did you get in?\" Aw, shucks, Mr. Timberlaaa Oh. The performer had just as quickly gotten up and was standing by the runway. The singer-designer was stressed. He was watching models rehearse for the first fashion show of a collection called William Rast, a year-old collaboration between Timberlake and Trace Ayala, his best friend since childhood. He was aware of the critical trouncing delivered to other celebrities who have attempted to commercialize their personal style with a fashion line. \"I don't want to look like a celebrity who is cashing in on celebrity,\" Timberlake said. \"That's my fear.\" Although Ayala designed the clothes, it was Timberlake who was making the fashion show a production, selecting the music, conceiving the set, taping the fake red-carpet interview as a sly statement on the hyped nature of celebrity collections it would play as celebrity guests took their seats and personally casting the dancers and models. The day before the show, several of the models were moping or chomping on gum, unable to manage a fairly uncomplicated routine that required one turn and one half turn. One stomped down the runway like a Clydesdale, comically attempting the signature march of Gisele Bundchen. Timberlake made a bug-eye face, then pretended to stumble across the room. As most music-conscious people have heard, Timberlake is bringing sexy back; that is, his contagious single of that title has dominated global pop charts since September, and it has even been used as a punch line by Al Gore, when he appeared on the Video Music Awards and said he had heeded Timberlake's call. Critics have praised the album with the single \"FutureSex/LoveSounds\" the second solo album by Timberlake, formerly \"the cute one\" in the boy band *NSYNC. In another step toward his transformation into an adult act, Timberlake has taken on serious acting roles, including a part in Nick Cassavetes' crime drama \"Alpha Dog,\" and now he wants to expand his claim on sexiness to fashion, with a runway show he and Ayala named \"Street Sexy.\" Showing restraint, Timberlake did not plan to play his hit until the finale of an after-party concert following the show. He seemed well aware that its popularity is in danger of becoming oppressive. \"At least I didn't bring Lycra back,\" he said. What has been interesting about Timberlake's approach to fashion is that, unlike other celebrities turned designers such as Sean Combs, Jennifer Lopez and Beyonce, he had not heavily promoted his involvement until recently. Ayala, 25, who worked with Timberlake as a personal assistant and designed clothes for *NSYNC, persuaded the singer to start the collection a year ago, after being approached by Danny Guez, the owner of the Los Angeles denim company People's Liberation. Timberlake's name was kept off the label to avoid the overt appearance of cashing in on his celebrity, but he approves all of the designs and comes up with some of them. William Rast, named after two of Timberlake's and Ayala's grandfathers, began selling $180 bootcut jeans at Bloomingdale's and a handful of other stores. The idea was that the partners would perfect their basic designs before making a more ambitious fashion statement. Ever since Combs, building on a career as a rap impresario, introduced his Sean John collection in 1998, the fashion industry has been overrun by music celebrities. But so far the success of Combs he was named menswear designer of the year in 2004 by the Council of American Fashion Designers has been more the exception than the rule. There have been reports of production problems for Lopez's line, exaggerated sales figures from Russell Simmons and a lawsuit against Jessica Simpson, claiming she did little to promote her own line. \"We have departments for clothes, not celebrities,\" said Frank Doroff, a senior executive vice president at Bloomingdale's . \"Quite a few of the lines we feel are not appropriate for Bloomingdale's or that they really don't sell.\" The rollout of William Rast has been limited. In early interviews, Guez gave sales projections of about $15 million for the first year, but he declined to say whether his company, which went public in December, had met that target. Still, Doroff said it is one of the two celebrity lines carried by Bloomingdale's that have connected with shoppers, along with LAMB by Gwen Stefani. Timberlake has been savvy about his image since beginning his solo career in 2002. He has successfully erased the taint of his adolescent romance with Britney Spears, and he transferred the stigma of the infamous wardrobe malfunction at the Super Bowl almost entirely onto his duet partner, Janet Jackson. He has worked with stylist Joe Zee, the editor of Vitals magazine (now defunct), to change his own look from leather eightball jackets, gold chains and faded jeans to a more adult one of rakish fedoras, skinny monochromatic Dior suits and three-piece tweed suits from Yves Saint Laurent. \"My style changes like the seasons,\" he said. \"I've grown up in the business, and I've had the double-edged sword of having everyone see my odd years. You can document them on the red carpet, and they are absolutely hysterical. I look back at some of the things I wore when I was 17, and I wonder, what was I thinking? Obviously, I was 17.\" He is now 25. Before the September releaseof \"FutureSex/LoveSounds,\" Zee said he flew to Los Angeles to present the singer with photo-collages to inspire his look for the album's marketing, showing him pictures of classic Hollywood rogues like Frank Sinatra and Sammy Davis Jr. \"He got it right away,\" Zee said. \"He's far more advanced than Madonna was at his age. You can only imagine where he'll be when he gets to 45.\" Timberlake's music, his performances and his style could be described as deliberately unconstructed, as though he had practiced in front of a mirror a few times before trying it out in public. His approach to creating a fashion brand comes across as intently studied, surreally so when Timberlake speaks of his desire to build a total lifestyle collection, using fashion-industry jargon as if to demonstrate his seriousness. \"In my opinion, there are a lot of denim brands out there that miss the point of jeans . Jeans are a canvas. I see a lot of jeans that if I was to wear them, I would have to work my outfit around them.\" An hour before the show, Cameron Diaz, Timberlake's girlfriend, was sitting on the runway, talking to friends in the front row and tugging the back of her sparkly shirt down over her William Rast jeans, so as not to expose herself to guests on the other side of the runway such as Patrick Dempsey, \"Dr. McDreamy\" of \"Grey's Anatomy.\" Also in the house were Eve, Wilmer Valderrama, Michelle Trachtenberg, Paris and Nicky Hilton, and Timberlake's former boy-band colleagues Lance Bass and JC Chasez . What's sexy to you? \"Him,\" Bass said, pointing to his boyfriend, Reichen Lehmkuhl. \"I think confidence is sexy.\" Lehmkuhl added, \"Sexy is when someone knows how to be confident and how to tell someone else they look good.\" Mmm. The show included women in short denim skirts and men in ultraskinny jeans with cuffs that rolled back to midcalf, good for a celebrity runway show but not much different from what one would encounter at a Diesel fashion show or one of Dsquared. It was amazing, really, that they were having an elaborate event for a collection of just 20-some pairs of jeans and T-shirts, styled as the competing gangs from \"The Outsiders.\" The greasers wore their hair styled into mullets, with Western gingham shirts and rockabilly gold bow ties on white blouses; the preppy Socials wore similar pieces, tidied up with a pale yellow cropped cardigan, for example, and Tretorn sneakers. A few short prairie dresses and a retro plaid sports jacket over slim khaki pants for men represented the expansion of William Rast; the fireworks were saved for the dancers. The B-boys somersaulted over one another, their sneakers at moments within inches of celebrity airspace, and a group of lascivious-looking women bumped and ground their way along the stage. \"What really makes clothing sexy is what you do with it,\" the voice of Timberlake said as he took his bow with Ayala.",

                "text": "By JON FRANK For a change, U.S. Rep. Thelma Drake is relaxing on the front porch of her waterfront home in Norfolk's Ocean View neighborhood. Even though Drake is in the middle of a heated re-election campaign against Democrat Phil Kellam, the 56-year-old congresswoman looks like a vacationing tourist without a care in the world. On most days of the campaign season, Drake is in a rush, grabbing a bite of finger food for sustenance as she courts votes at community centers and VFW posts. But today, Drake is kicking back. Suddenly, two of her grandchildren, 6-year-old Jonathan and 4-year-old Eli, run onto the porch, ready for the beach. \"We think we live in paradise,\" Drake said, strolling to a sloping sand dune in front of her two-story home on Chesapeake Bay. \"Not bad for a girl from Elyria, Ohio. \" Despite being a native of the Midwest, the conservative Republican fits nicely in red-state Virginia. Drake, whose credentials stretch back to Barry Goldwater, now attracts support from the Bush administration like few other members of Congress. The race is one of the nation's most competitive, and will be key to Republican efforts to retain control of Congress. President Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney and first lady Laura Bush all have visited South Hampton Roads this year to raise money for Drake. Her Republican colleagues on Capitol Hill say she's earned the support. \"As a new member of Congress, she is the best I have ever seen,\" said Rep. Duncan Hunter of California, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee and a 26-year veteran of the House. At a February fundraiser in Norfolk, Cheney had this to say: \"It would be a better Congress if we had more members like Thelma.\" Such visits helped Drake set a new fundraising record in the district with close to $2 million, according to her campaign office. At home, however, Drake is a comfort-food-cooking grandmother with four grand children. She loves listening to bluegrass music, her husband's mandolin playing and talk radio, especially Sean Hannity and Bill O'Reilly. She's unusual because of where she came from, says Rep. J. Randy Forbes, Drake's counterpart in Congress from Chesapeake. David Slayton, senior vice president of Dynamic Animation Systems in Fairfax, coaches Drake as she tries her hand at simulated shooting during a military-oriented trade show in Washington. Drake's rise to prominence, he says, is \"a picture of what American success stories are all about.\" Drake's real estate investments are worth millions. She owns 14 properties, including two in Ocean View worth between $500,000 and $1 million each, according to her financial disclosure form, and 10 others worth at least $100,000 each. Drake became wealthy, and got to Washington, by building on a string of professional successes - a lucrative real estate career and political victories - and learning from personal difficulties. She has no college degree. She became pregnant in high school, lived paycheck to paycheck and suffered through two divorces and the deaths of two stepchildren. \"Thelma is smart in a different sort of way,\" said Leo C. Wardrup Jr., who sat next to Drake for nine years in the Virginia General Assembly and watched her tremendous drive and independence. Drake was born in 1949 into a Catholic family of Democrats in a working-class, Rust Belt town 30 miles west of Cleveland. She has roots in Newfoundland, Canada, where her mother and several siblings live. Drake remembers with clarity a conversation she had with a nun at Elyria Catholic High School in which she was told she probably would not realize her dream of going to college. In fact, Drake left Catholic school during her senior year after she became pregnant. But she enrolled in public school and, showing the persever ance that has become her trademark, graduated on time. A year later, instead of sitting in a college classroom - or demonstrating against the Vietnam War, which Drake says proudly she would never have done - she was learning to be a mom to her baby daughter, Lynn. Soon after, Drake married a Navy man and the couple, with her daughter, moved to Norfolk in 1967. Two years later, her husband left. As a single mom, Drake began a non traditional education that helped turn her into the strong-willed legislator and fierce campaigner that her colleagues on both sides of the aisle know today. \"Thelma has the most important kind of education: practical experience and street smarts,\" Forbes said. \"You can't buy that. You have to earn it.\" But for years, Drake struggled with money and relationships. In 1974 she met and married Joe Sawyers, a man with six children. The couple blended their families and began a real estate partnership to manage several rental properties Sawyers owned. In less than a year, one of Sawyers' sons was killed and another drowned in the Chesapeake Bay. The family moved to the Peninsula, but eventually Drake and Sawyers returned and had a son, Mark, now 30. Drake became active in Little League and PTA, eventually becoming president of the Granby High School PTA. In 1980, she was named Citizen of the Year by the Virginia Crime Prevention Association for her work with Neighborhood Watch. Drake and Sawyers divorced in 1984. Drake digs for small crabs with two of her grandchildren, Jonathan, 6, left, and Eli, 4, along the beach in front of her Ocean View home. Her financial goals at the time were very modest, said her husband, Ted Drake, whom she married in 1990. \"One of them was to own a refrigerator with a shelf in it,\" he said. She soon began selling real estate, and showed a talent for juggling many tasks at once. She says she learned the business from Joan Gifford, a prominent real estate businesswoman whom Drake describes as mentor, friend and mother figure. Gifford, 84, recently recalled Drake coming to her to apply for a job as a secretary in the 1980s. Gifford said that Drake, who had two children to support, desperately needed money. Soon after the interview began, though, Gifford said she \"recognized something very special in Thelma.\" She told Drake to forget the secretarial job. She offered her a position in real estate sales. Drake's spot in the Million Dollar Club, which she earned her first year in real estate and every year until she went to Congress, was especially impressive in those days, Gifford said, when many houses in Norfolk were selling for between $7,000 and $10,000. Drake's first political opponent, Democrat Howard Copeland, remembers an early meeting with Drake in 1982. Both were living in Bayview. Copeland, an Ivy Leaguer with a University of Virginia law degree who served in the General Assembly from 1980 until 1995, recalls Drake coming to his front door with a housewarming gift - a cake. It was election season, and Copeland was being challenged by a Republican. He assumed that Drake's gift was a sign of support. A short time after, however, Copeland saw a sign for his opponent on Drake's front lawn. \"I was shocked,\" Copeland remembered. Drake lost her first race against Copeland in 1993, but tried again in 1995 and won. First lady Laura Bush poses with Drake and her supporters at a recent fundraising breakfast for Virginia's 2nd District at the Waterside Marriott in Norfolk. \"She was a much slicker campaigner than I was,\" recalled Copeland. \"But I didn't find a lot of substance. She would just say, 'Hi, I'm Thelma Drake and I really want to go to Richmond.' \" She did. For nine years. On the floor of the House, Drake was the \"secret weapon\" for the Hampton Roads delegation, said Wardrup, a Virginia Beach Republican and former naval officer who has served since 1992 in the House of Delegates. \"I was the warm-up person,\" Wardrup said. \"Thelma would bring it home.\" Drake knew how to \"schmooze\" a bill, Wardrup said. He gives Drake special credit for her work on housing issues and her efforts to make it easier for unmarried people to qualify for home loans, something that is especially important for members of the military. She worked behind the scenes, he said, to smooth out the rough parts of legislation before they became roadblocks. In 2004, when Rep. Ed Schrock decided not to seek re-election, other candidates were interested in the seat. Drake, Wardrup said, had all the right stuff. She was the right age, a good campaigner, a proven winner and had the grass-roots support necessary to win the nomination, Wardrup said. Ted Drake, who met his wife at a 1987 party in Bayview, said he now knows \"how Navy wives feel.\" His wife's job keeps her away from South Hampton Roads for much of the year, leaving less time for family activities. Thelma Drake always devoted long hours to her real estate work, he said, so he is used to her reading stacks of books and position papers late at night. But now the issues are terrorism and economic development, not mortgage rates and closing costs. \"She has one of the most important jobs in the world,\" said Ted Drake. \"And she is doing the job wholeheartedly.\" Reach Jon Frank at or THELMA DRAKE Republican Residence Norfolk Occupation U.S. representative, 2nd District of Virginia Personal Born in Elyria, Ohio; age 56; married to Ted Drake; two children Experience Member, Virginia House of Delegates, 1; U.S. House of Representatives, 2004 to present.

                "text": "By JON FRANK Phil Kellam rides in the back seat of a 1999 Ford Expedition, alternately using his cell phone and his laptop while his communications director drives the rain-slicked roads of Virginia Beach. Kellam is between campaign stops, electronically working the network of Democratic supporters that is trying to help him unseat U.S. Rep. Thelma Drake, the first-term Republican congresswoman from Norfolk who represents Virginia's 2nd District. Kellam, the Virginia Beach revenue commissioner, who is the only elected Democrat in the city, plans to address residents of a Beach senior citizens home and then speak to a luncheon of Kiwanis Club members in Norfolk. \"This is a traveling office,\" Kellam says, as the Expedition heads down Shore Drive. \"I don't see how people could run a campaign being only in one place.\" It's electioneering, 21st-century style. But one thing hasn't changed, says Kellam as he completes one phone conversation and begins punching in another number. \"At the end of the day, if you are asking somebody for $1,000, you have to do it personally.\" Kellam, 50, a Beach native who looks 10 years younger than his age, has been doing a lot of that in 2006. With blond hair and the carriage of an athlete, Kellam has the relaxed demeanor of a surfer who hops on the road on the spur of the moment to surf Hatteras Island or Wrightsville Beach. The surf culture that helped shape Kellam still exerts an influence. When time and ocean conditions allow, Kellam will ride the occasional wave with sons Alex, 18, and Jay, 8. The problem is, these days, there is no time. Despite being a member of a legendary and political Beach family, with connections that go back several generations of voters, Kellam has been way behind in fundraising since the beginning of this congressional campaign. He's trying to unseat an incumbent with strong ties to the Bush administration, and it's an uphill struggle. Kellam works on a speech inside his campaign headquarters off Witchduck Road in Virginia Beach. At the end of September, Kellam's $1.1 million total had been nearly doubled by Drake, who raised just less than $2 million to set a record for 2nd District races, according to her campaign staff. That hasn't deterred Kellam, who has had some celebrity help of his own. Bestselling author John Grisham, who lives some of the year near Charlottesville, has contributed to Kellam's campaign, and House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer of Maryland visited the district during the summer to lend a hand. Kellam hopes to capitalize on the problems in Iraq and scandals within the GOP's congressional leadership. Several polls taken near the end of the summer showed Kellam and Drake nearly deadlocked. The polls have energized local Democrats into believing that Kellam can win in a district heavy with active-duty and retired military and a Republican stronghold for six years. \"The public gets it,\" Kellam says with confidence as the Expedition pulls into Westminster Canterbury, where Kellam's mother, Alice, lives with other well-to-do senior citizens. \"The public knows what kind of operator I am, and my track record. The public knows that I am sincere.\" Kellam has been building his record since 1997, when he was first elected commissioner of revenue. He made his mark by doing what nearly every taxpayer wants done: He reduced staff by 24 percent, increased productivity, and took up less space at the municipal center. He also got rid of the city sticker, a move that streamlined city government at the Beach, and elsewhere, as other localities followed suit. \"He should take some pride in that,\" said John T. Atkinson, the Republican Virginia Beach treasurer who opposed the sticker removal but now acknowledges it was a good move. The information formerly gathered by the sticker is now collected when license plates are renewed at the Department of Motor Vehicles, said Eric Schmudde, Kellam's chief deputy. The productivity boost, Schmudde said, has been achieved, in part, by automation. When Kellam took office, there were 20 computers and 85 employees, he said; the office now has 90 computers and 61 employees. Kellam also opened the DMV's first satellite office, which allows most driver-related tasks, except license renewal, to be done at the commissioner of revenue office, Schmudde said. Critics of Kellam say his accomplishments are overrated. Kellam campaigns in late August at Westminster Canterbury on Chesapeake Bay, in Virginia Beach, where his mother is a resident. The sticker fee is still collected by the state. And the budget cuts were achieved by getting rid of long-term employees and replacing them with newcomers, they said. They wonder more about the unanswered question in Kellam's candidacy: how big a role the Kellam family name will play in the election. His paternal grandfather, Abel E. Kellam, was clerk of the court for Princess Anne County and had 17 children. One of his 15 sons, Sidney, was a key player in the Byrd organization, the Democratic Party's 20th-century political dynasty in Virginia. As treasurer, Sidney was considered the political leader in Princess Anne County for 40 years. Two of the Kellam brothers were judges. Floyd was on the Circuit Court, and Phil's father, Richard, was on the U.S. District Court. Another brother, Bill, was a state senator. Today, the family name appears on street signs, businesses and schools. Phil remembers being asked, while a student at Kellam High School, whether he owned the place. Phil Kellam is the only one of the 26 Kellam cousins who has gone into politics. \"I wanted to be as far away from it as possible,\" said Phil's older sister, Martha Kellam Stone. Her brother, however, always seemed \"fascinated\" by politics, Stone said. \"He used to talk a lot to Uncle Sidney,\" she remembered. \"I thought he probably would end up in politics.\" Kellam attended boarding school in Richmond, finished at Kellam High and then went to Elon College in North Carolina, where he majored in political science and met his future wife, Andi. The couple raised their two sons at the Kellam family homestead until their divorce in 2004 after 21 years of marriage. Andi said their family relationship remains strong, especially around Christmas, a time that Kellam loves and tries to extend whenever possible. \"I remember telling him once: 'It's almost Valentine's Day. Don't you think we ought to take the Christmas decorations down?' \" Andi recalled. Local Republicans concede that the Kellam name is formidable, especially in Virginia Beach, where the vast majority of 2nd District voters resides. But the city no longer has the demographic makeup it had in Sidney Kellam's day, said Bruce Meyer, the 2nd District chairman for the Republicans. Newcomers, he said, are more familiar with the name through Kellam High School, which was named after Circuit Judge Floyd Kellam, Phil 's uncle. Kellam heads out the back door of his home in Virginia Beach. It is where, this fall, he hosted an event known as the Elephant Roast a swipe at the GOP symbol. Atkinson, Virginia Beach's treasurer for 28 years, and once the only elected Republican in Virginia Beach, said the Kellam family name still carries clout, but \"this is a Republican city.\" When Virginia Beach and Princess Anne County were run by Democrats, it was the Kellam family home on Princess Anne Road that symbolized political power. Phil Kellam still lives there. It is only a short walk away from the commissioners office he runs. But Kellam has another reason to love the multistory, white frame homestead, nestled in a grove of pine, oak and magnolia trees. Each fall he hosts a political event there known as the Elephant Roast, a dig at the GOP's big-eared symbol and an event open only to Democrats. At this year's event, Kellam spoke only briefly, recalling that the Kellam legacy still permeates the old homestead. Growing up where scores of political careers began and ended shaped him, he said, and continues to drive his desire to remain in politics. \"In the family that I grew up in, we were taught to do something about our community if we thought we could make a difference,\" Kellam said during an interview. \"I saw what you could do if you got involved in public life.\" Edwin Kellam, one of his cousins, believes Kellam made the right choice. \"He absolutely loves what he does,\" Edwin Kellam said, \"being with people, and the politics.\" Kellam understands that Congress is a huge responsibility, even for someone who loves the arena of public policy and has an especially strong component of political DNA coursing through his veins. \"My life is pretty darn good,\" Kellam said as his Expedition pulled away from the Kiwanis Club luncheon. \"So why would I want to endure all of this and run for office every two years? Because it needs to be done. If not me, then who?\" Reach Jon Frank at or PHILIP J.

                "text": "It has been a season Booker T. Washington coach Larry Stepney would rather forget. The Bookers (1-5) are off to their worst start since 2000, when they finished 2-8. But Stepney's pain extends beyond the field. Since Aug. 23, he has had back spasms caused by a car accident. He was hospitalized for high blood pressure and missed the Bookers' game against Deep Creek. He's now battling a sinus infection and gout in his right foot. \"We had a week off two weeks ago, and I started to get myself together,\" said Stepney, 53. \"Then all of a sudden, gout hit. My foot swelled, so that I was on crutches last week during the Churchland game. I get one thing repaired, and something else comes up.\" Stepney, in his 15th season at Booker T. Washington, said retiring has crossed his mind. But he doesn't want to end his coaching career like this. \"I'm going to weigh the situation and talk to my wife, and then make a decision from there,\" he said. \"But I really don't want to go out this way. I can't go out like this. \"If I do come back next year, it will be my last unless something else comes up where I can just coach.\" Stepney, who missed practice Monday because of his foot and sinuses, expects to be on the sideline Thursday when the Bookers play Maury. Stepney's team can't catch a break, either The old adage \"when it rains, it pours\" definitely has hit Booker T. Washington. With coach Larry Stepney already ailing and on crutches as the Bookers prepared to play Churchland, they also learned before the game that standout tight end/linebacker Adidias Arrington dislocated his jaw on the bus ride to the game. Arrington, a 6-foot-2, 205-pound senior, fell asleep on the bus. When he woke up and yawned, his jaw popped. \"This kid has muscles everywhere,\" Stepney said. \"And out of all the muscles to relax, it was his jaw muscle.\" Oscar Smith freshman to be at QB vs. Deep Creek Oscar Smith freshman Phillip Sims likely will get his third consecutive start at quarterback when the top-ranked Tigers take on No. 3 Deep Creek in a Southeastern District game Friday pitting a pair of unbeaten teams. Sims has started the past two games in place of star Dexter Merritt, a senior who suffered a third-degree medial collateral right knee sprain Sept. 29 against Western Branch. \"Dexter's walking well, and he's pretty mobile right now, but he hasn't been cleared to play,\" Oscar Smith coach Richard Morgan said Tuesday. \"So right now Sims is the guy getting all the reps, and Dex is at practice watching and helping him out.\" Sims threw just one pass in relief of Merritt against Western Branch but has been impressive in victories over Granby and Nansemond River. Sims has completed 25 of 36 passes for six touchdowns and 460 yards, with no interceptions. Barring a remarkable turnaround by Merritt, Sims will be behind center Friday in a match-up the Tigers won 24-21 last season. \"Dex would have to show some more mobility, and right now I'm not holding out hope that he's going to play this week,\" Morgan said. \"We're putting in the game plan with Phillip this week.\" Indian River QB Poittilo might return this week Another Southeastern District starting QB could return to the field Friday. Indian River's Dravon Poittilo's status will be a \"game-time decision,\" according to coach Cadillac Harris, whose team hosts Lakeland. Poittilo missed Saturday's loss against Lake Taylor after suffering a concussion in Indian River's previous game. Poittilo joins a list of walking wounded for the Braves, who have been plagued by injuries since a season-opening upset of Hampton. Indian River was without two starting wide receivers in a loss to Deep Creek, and Harris said a \"rash of concussions\" hit the Braves in recent weeks. Starting defensive tackle Quincy Davis also was one of four players who missed Saturday's game. Despite 0-6 record, Hudak not looking back Granby coach Dave Hudak insists he has no regrets. Last March, he accepted the head-coaching position at Landstown only to change his mind a month later and return to Granby. The Eagles are 5-2 this season - the Comets are 0-6. \"I'm happy for them, but my decision wasn't based on who was going to have the better season,\" said Hudak, now in his 21st season at Granby. \"You never anticipate starting off the season with six losses, but I also knew there would be some growing pains because we had to move people around from positions they normally play.. But we're improving every day.\" Hudak said it's good that he returned because he said a new coach would have been frustrated by the start. \"I'm right where I want to be,\" Hudak said. \"I've got Granby running through me, and there's no other place I'd rather be.\" But for how long? \"When I came back, I was thinking I'd stay for two more years,\" he said. \"But (Granby administrators) keep talking about two or three years. We'll play it by ear. Right now the plan is this year, next year, and then we'll see.\" Tallwood QB determined to play no matter what For those who aren't paying attention, Tallwood has the second-best record in the Beach District at 5-1. \"It sounds pretty good, but we still have four games left, so we can't too excited yet,\" Lions QB Brian Jackson said. \"We have the power to control our destiny.. Hopefully we can keep playing like we're playing right now.\" Jackson had another big game in leading the Lions past Kempsville 23-17. He completed 10 of 18 passes for 185 yards and a touchdown. He accomplished all of this despite a bad cut to his throwing hand. He injured the hand, which required 10 stitches, on the first play of the game. He thinks he cut it on an opposing player's helmet. \"I didn't want to go out after the first play,\" he said. \"There was still 47 minutes left, and anything could happen. I could worry about my hand after the game.\" Jackson said the injury will not keep him out of Friday's home game against Cox. \"Nothing is going to hold me back from playing,\" he said. \"I could have a broken hand, and I'm still going to try my best to play.\" Deep Creek announcer jumped gun on Kirkland Deep Creek QB Sam Kirkland said it was just a slip. Kirkland, a senior, was participating in Deep Creek's homecoming ceremonies last Friday when the public address announcer proclaimed that Kirkland would attend Maryland on a football scholarship. The news was received with a huge ovation. But not so fast. Kirkland, a 6-foot, 190-pounder, said he has not made his college decision. He said he is interested in a list of schools that includes Syracuse, N.C. State, Maryland, Virginia Tech, South Carolina, Tennessee, UNC, East Carolina, Penn State, Marshall and James Madison. He added that Madison is the only program that has offered him a scholarship. Madison also is the only one interested in him as a quarterback. \"Most schools want me as a defensive back or wide receiver,\" he said. \"I'll be happy with any place that can use my athletic ability.\" At the moment, the only thing on Kirkland's mind is Friday's game against top-ranked Oscar Smith. \"I've been waiting on this game all year,\" Kirkland said. \"It's our rival, and a lot is at stake. They've beaten us the last three years, but we feel we can play with them. We'll see what happens on Friday.\" TD was a dream come true for Salem's Okoli Chimaeze Okoli, Salem's 6-foot-5, 275-pound defensive end, couldn't believe his eyes. Okoli was rushing the passer during the first quarter of Friday's game against Landstown when he saw the football hit the ground. \"That was surreal to me,\" Okoli said. \"It felt like it almost didn't happen.\" It did, and Okoli scooped up the fumble and lumbered 10 yards for a touchdown. The score gave Salem a three-touchdown lead and helped propel the unbeaten Sun Devils to a 42-2 victory. Okoli had 2-1/2 sacks and recovered two fumbles, but he won't soon forget his first career touchdown. \"The ball popped right to me,\" Okoli said. \"I tell you, I dream about that so much. That's every single D-lineman's dream. I didn't even know what to do.\" - Compiled by Larry Rubama and Jami Frankenberry",

                "text": "This winter's General Assembly session largely was about money and lessons learned from the Virginia Tech tragedy. Cash was tight and lawmakers had to extend the session five days beyond their scheduled adjournment before they agreed on a two-year, $77 billion budget that will go into effect July 1. Nobody got all they wanted. Teachers will receive a 2 percent raise in July 2009. State employees and college faculty members will get 2 percent boosts at the end of this year and next. Six hundred new community care openings will be created for the mentally disabled. The state will spend $22 million to expand prekindergarten programs for children from low-income families. There was no money left to aid museums and cultural programs. Local governments will take a 5 percent cut in state funding. Lawmakers are still searching for dollars to improve transportation in South Hampton Roads and Northern Virginia. The General Assembly, with many of its members unwilling to vote to raise taxes, is expected take up road funding in a special session this spring. Thoughts never strayed far from Virginia Tech, where a gunman with a history of psychological problems killed 32 students and faculty members before committing suicide April 16. Lawmakers approved a $42 million revamping of the mental health system and broadened the threshold for involuntarily committing a people to institutions. Still left to be done in special sessions to be held in late April will be attempts to find a compromise on how to pay for major transportation projects in Hampton Roads and Northern Virginia. Legislators also hope to reach an agreement on judicial appointments. Here are the fates of some of the bills that were considered by the General Assembly this year.

                "text": "No. 3 Western Branch at Nansemond River Records: Western Branch 7-1 overall, 5-1 Southeastern District; Nansemond River 2-7, 1-6 The lowdown: Western Branch is in the thick of the Division 6 playoff race and needs a victory to set up a regular-season finale showdown against rival Deep Creek. The Bruins have won four in a row - all by 12 points or less - since losing to Oscar Smith. The Bruins rank sixth in South Hampton Roads in total defense, yielding an average of 169.2 yards per game. Nansemond River is playing in its season finale, and the Warriors have never defeated Western Branch. The teams began playing when Nansemond River moved to Group AAA in 1996. Warriors RB Jamar Jarrell has rushed for 631 yards, and WR Darryl Freeney leads the Southeastern District in scoring with 48 points (7 TDs, three 2-point conversions). Jami says: Tune-up time. Western Branch, 30-12. Larry says: Bruins roll as they prepare for the Creek. Western Branch, 33-15. Great Bridge vs. No. 4 Maury Site: Powhatan Field Records: Great Bridge 3-5, Maury 7-1 The lowdown: Maury has won the past two meetings in this non-district series, including 49-35 last season. Great Bridge has lost three of its past four games, but all three losses are by six points or less. The Wildcats fell 24-21 last week to Deep Creek. Great Bridge QB Casey Turner continues to fly up the all-time passing charts, and he's 8 yards from moving into fifth in career yards in South Hampton Roads. Three of Turner's targets - David Reynolds, Austin Taylor and Chris Stewart - are in the top five this season in receiving. Maury, riding a seven-game winning streak, appears headed for its first outright Eastern District title since 1990, with only one-win Granby remaining on the schedule. QB Stephen Kelley is 93 yards from his second consecutive 1,000-yard passing season. He threw for 1,274 yards last season at Indian River. Jami says: Commodores haven't played a .500 team since September. Maury, 38-24. Larry says: Maury hasn't seen a quarterback like this. Great Bridge, 37-34. No. 6 Deep Creek at Lakeland Records: Deep Creek 7-1 overall, 5-1 Southeastern District; Lakeland 1-7, 0-6 The lowdown: Deep Creek kept its playoff hopes alive by slipping past Great Bridge 24-21 last week. The Hornets have won four games by a TD or less. Lakeland snapped a 17-game losing streak with last week's 9-6 victory over Norcom. The Cavaliers haven't defeated Deep Creek since moving to Group AAA in 1996 and have scored nine total points in the teams' past two meetings. Jami says: Hornets can't wait for Western Branch. Deep Creek, 35-7. Larry says: Lakeland's one-game winning streak comes to an end. Deep Creek, 34-13. Green Run at No. 9 Landstown Records: Green Run 1-8 overall and Beach District, Landstown 6-2 The lowdown: Green Run enters its season finale on a five-game losing streak, and the Stallions never have defeated Landstown, which opened in 2001. Green Run WR Ronnie Dozier has 23 catches and is averaging 19.2 yards per reception. Landstown aims to keep its Division 6 playoff hopes alive and finishes the regular season next week against Bayside. The Eagles are coming off a bye. Sophomore RB Sterlin Phifer has been overshadowed in the Beach by big-name backs at Kempsville and Salem, but Phifer has 762 yards and six TDs. Jami says: Eagles won't be caught looking ahead. Landstown, 38-14. Larry says: Eagles keep playoff hopes alive. Landstown, 33-27. Ocean Lakes at No. 10 Kellam Records: Ocean Lakes 3-5 overall and Beach District, Kellam 6-2 The lowdown: Kellam needs to finish with victories today and next week against unbeaten Salem to keep its playoff hopes alive. The Knights, winner of three consecutive games, have the Beach District's top rushing offense, led by Javon Boddie's 685 yards. Kellam has won three straight games against Ocean Lakes. The Dolphins have lost back-to-back games and five of their past six. QB/RB/WR Marcus Davis caught six passes last Friday for 57 yards after rushing for 116 yards two weeks ago. Jami says: Knights need this one more. Kellam, 24-14. Larry says: Ocean Lakes' streak of 11 consecutive better-than-.500 seasons comes to an end. Kellam, 34-23. King's Fork at Indian River Records: King's Fork 3-5 overall, 2-4 Southeastern District; Indian River 4-4, 3-3 The lowdown: King's Fork was one quarter from pulling off a shocker last Friday but let a lead slip away against unbeaten Oscar Smith. The Bulldogs, playing in their third season, have been outscored 118-6 in two previous meetings with Indian River. The Braves have slipped out of playoff contention, but all of their losses are by 17 points or less. Sophomore QB Dravon Poittilo has thrown for 1,253 yards and 11 TDs. Jami says: Be careful, Braves. Indian River, 23-20. Larry says: King's Fork a pushover no more. Indian River, 27-20. Princess Anne at Cox Records: Princess Anne 0-8 overall and Beach District, Cox 1-7 The lowdown: Princess Anne, which finishes next week against Ocean Lakes, appears headed to its first winless season since 1988. The Cavaliers have lost 13 consecutive games and last finished better than .500 in 2000. Cox has lost three consecutive games, scoring two TDs in that span. Drew Jarrett has six FGs, tying him with Kempsville's Sean Teufel for the Beach District lead. Jami says: This one might be tough to watch. Cox, 9-6. Larry says: Princess Anne has been outscored 291-43 this season. Cox, 33-18. Bayside at First Colonial Records: Bayside 5-3 overall and Beach District, First Colonial 4-4 The lowdown: Bayside is coming off a 27-6 loss to Salem - a loss that doomed the Marlins' playoff hopes. QB E.J. Manuel was held to a season-low 91 yards, but he's 316 yards from breaking into South Hampton Roads' top-10 list of all-time passers. WR Jamal Johnson is one catch behind Great Bridge's David Reynolds for the South Hampton Roads receiving lead. Johnson has averaged 13.4 yards on his 43 catches. First Colonial RB Tony Gregory has 641 yards and seven TDs. He returned a kickoff 85 yards for a TD in last Friday's victory over Green Run. Jami says: Bayside, 27-22. Larry says: Bayside 37-27. Wilson at Norcom Records: Wilson 0-8 overall, 0-5 Eastern District; Norcom 2-6, 2-3 The lowdown: Wilson has lost 18 consecutive games, and last week's 24-0 loss to previously winless Granby was the Presidents' fifth by shutout this season. Norcom fell to Lakeland 9-6 last week, snapping the Cavaliers' 17-game skid. The Greyhounds have lost three of their past four games and are headed for their fourth consecutive losing season. With 844 yards, QB Cameron White is second in the Eastern District in passing. Jami says: Norcom, 23-0. Larry says: Norcom, 14-0. Granby at Booker T. Washington Records: Granby 1-7 overall, 1-4 Eastern District; Booker T. Washington 1-7, 1-4 The lowdown: Granby is coming off its first victory, 24-0 over Wilson, halting a nine-game losing streak. The Comets had scored seven total points in their previous three games. The Bookers have lost four in a row but played Lake Taylor tough before losing 20-14 last week. Jami says: Booker T. Washington, 23-14. Larry says: Booker T. Washington, 19-16. Norfolk Academy at Woodberry Forest Time: 3 p.m. Records: Norfolk Academy 6-2, Woodberry Forest 3-4 The lowdown: The Bulldogs slipped into a tie for second with Flint Hill in the VIS Division I rankings after last week's blowout loss to No. 1 Collegiate of Richmond. The Bulldogs still figure to make postseason play for the first time since 1997. Woodberry Forest lost 27-21 to Norfolk Academy last season, ending the Tigers' seven-game winning streak in the series. Woodberry Forest RB Femi Oyalowo has rushed for 365 yards in the past three games. Jami says: Norfolk Academy, 28-20. Larry says: Norfolk Academy, 33-24. Nansemond-Suffolk at Hampton Roads Academy Records: Nansemond-Suffolk Academy 2-7 overall, 2-1 Tidewater Conference; Hampton Roads Academy 5-2, 2-1 The lowdown: Both teams play their season finale in a game that will decide second place in the TCIS.

Larry says: Hampton Roads, 27-23. Isle of Wight Academy at Greenbrier Christian Records: Isle of Wight Academy 8-1, Greenbrier Christian 2-6 The lowdown: Isle of Wight Academy, a defending private school state champion, is the top-ranked team in VIS Division III and steps up a level to face the Division II Gators. The Chargers won this match-up 48-25 last season. Isle of Wight Academy figures to host a state semifinal next week. The Chargers have split back-to-back one-point games, squeaking past rival Southampton Academy 22-21 last week. Jami says: Isle of Wight, 34-20. Larry says: Isle of Wight, 41-24.

                "text": "VirginianPilot-Whethe \"Mission: Impossible III\" (audio: ****, video: ****, extras: ****) the hyperkinetic thriller and the best of the franchise, is available in all three digital formats (DVD, HD-DVD, Blu-ray) in a two-disc collector's set. The high-def versions are clearly superior - especially the destructive missile attack on the Chesapeake Bay Bridge-Tunnel. The action sequence is mostly CGI, filmed on a makeshift bridge north of Los Angeles by TV wonder boy director J.J. Abrams (\"Lost,\" \"Alias\"). Short bursts of aerial photography highlight the Chesapeake Bay as Cruise and the IMF agents escort his toughest villain, Philip Seymour Hoffman (Owen Davian), back to headquarters. Davian escapes, kidnapping Hunt's beautiful bride, Julia (Michelle Monaghan), to create more mayhem. The HD-DVD version includes a pop-up video commentary (small window over the flick) with Cruise and Abrams. It's so informative, the duo actually stop the movie a couple of times so they can breakdown a scene more thoroughly. Also, four documentaries were taped in HD, chronicling the production in Rome, United States and China, watchable in high-def with the HD-DVD and Blu-ray discs. (HD widescreen and enhanced widescreen, 2006, PG-13 for intense sequences of frenetic violence and menace, disturbing images and some sensuality) Inline image:VirginianPilot-Whethe Also, the complete \"Mission Impossible: Ultimate Collection\" is now available in HD-DVD and Blu-ray box sets. \"Mission: Impossible\" (audio: ****, video: ****, extras: **1/2) from director Brian De Palma was filmed mostly in historic Prague, Czech Republic. It features a much younger Cruise and Jon Voight as deceptive team leader Jim Phelps. The disc includes half-dozen documentaries, also found on the DVD released in April. Two highlight Cruise's 20-plus-year career, including his acceptance speech at last year's MTV Movie Awards with fiancee Katie Homes at his side. You guessed it; the two were like giggling teenagers at the promo. (HD widescreen, 1996, PG-13 for intense action violence) \"Mission: Impossible II\" (audio: ****, video: ***, extras: ***) doesn't fair as well in HD, exposing excess film grain and contrast outlines. Clearly, this tale steals a few pages from Hitchcock's classic \"Notorious,\" with Cruise playing Cary Grant's role and Thandie Newton as Ingrid Bergman recruited to spy on her ex-lover. The disc includes a commentary with John Woo and three documentaries. (HD widescreen, 2000, PG-13 for intense sequences of violent action and some sensuality) - Bill Kelley III Inline image:VirginianPilot-quot There are ghosts - rather, Earthbound spirits - all around us. But only people like Melinda Gordon can see or help them. That's the premise of \"Ghost Whisperer: The Complete First Season\" (audio: ****, video, ****, extras: ****). Viewers may have tuned in to see the beautiful Jennifer Love Hewitt (Melinda). They stayed for well-written stories based on the experiences of \"ghostbuster\" Mary Ann Winkowski, paranormal investigator and consultant, and James Van Praagh, spiritual medium and co-executive producer. Both psychics had family members who helped them with their gifts when they were young. Their extraordinary experiences bring gravitas to Melinda's stories - which begin slowly and with charm to spare. Initially, Melinda is the happy newlywed starting out on her own. She has a new business, too, in the mythical town of Grandview which is sure to leave viewers with a big dose of deja vu. Turns out, it's the original set for the \"Back to the Future\" films. Extras here are absolutely worth the time. The stories pick up pace as Melinda's talents and her husband and partner, played by David Conrad and Aisha Tyler, are challenged more and more. Uneasy spirits include children, a suicide, accident victims, vengeance seekers and a literal hanged man. Stepping into the light has rarely been so suspenseful or so moving. \"We're in the life business,\" Melinda tells us. \"Death is just a part of it.\" (Enhanced widescreen, 2, not rated) - Kay Reynolds Choosing a Terry Gilliam film to watch is like selecting a Mounds candy. Sometimes you feel like a nut, sometimes you don't. Of the various enjoyable Gilliam films: \"Time Bandits,\" \"The Fisher King\" and \"The Adventures of Baron Munchausen\" - \"12 Monkeys\" (audio: ***, video, ***, extras, ***) just doesn't get my vote. That doesn't mean it's not a cult favorite of many. This is seriously grim science fiction from folks who had things to prove, not the least of which was Gilliam himself who wanted to show he could remain true to himself and make a profitable film. Star Bruce Willis wanted folks to know he had range outside of the \"Die Hard\" films and \"Moonlighting.\" Co-star Brad Pitt wanted to show he was more than just a pretty face. Everyone succeeds. \"12 Monkeys\" is frequently declared Gilliam's most accessible film. Willis and Pitt have never lacked for juicy roles since; both were critically acclaimed for their work here. With its deliberate visual grain, \"12 Monkeys\" doesn't lend itself to HD clarity. Some images are crystal sharp, others much less distinct. Yet you can't help but feel this is the way Gilliam wants it. His techniques are explored in a documentary \"The Hamster Factor & Other Tales of 12 Monkeys\" which tries to dissect Gilliam's directorial and story-telling vision. Feature commentary with Gilliam and producer Charles Roven also walks that path. Inline image:VirginianPilot-Whethe \"Out of Sight\" (audio: ***, video: ****, extras: ***) based on the book by Elmore Leonard (\"Get Shorty\") is the film nobody watched when it first came out. Now's your chance to pick up a cinematic gem - and on HD, too. First off, it's directed by Steven Soderbergh who gave us \"Ocean's 11,\" \"Erin Brockovich,\" and \"Traffic.\" It stars George Clooney, who was just breaking into film from his role on \"ER,\" and Jennifer Lopez, who was making the leap from \"Anaconda.\" Their chemistry together is sublime. They handle Leonard's dialogue in a way that's reminiscent of Cary Grant and Katherine Hepburn. Meanwhile, co-stars Don Cheadle, Steve Zahn, Ving Rhames and Dennis Farina try to steal the show real hard. (Be sure to catch Rhames dissertation on bubble baths among the deleted scenes and Clooney's reaction.) Albert Brooks and Michael Keaton also show up. It's a stellar cast. Soderbergh and screenwriter Scott Frank (\"Get Shorty,\" \"Minority Report,\" \"The Interpreter\") provide must-watch screen commentary. Rumor has it that Clooney and Lopez didn't always see eye-to-eye while filming, but you'd never know that from the documentary, \"Inside Out of Sight.\" Everyone gets to have their say, with Clooney cutting up as usual. If crime/action thrillers with snappy dialogue and great characters are your bag, don't miss this film. (Both: HD widescreen, R for language and violence) - Kay Reynolds Inline image:VirginianPilot-WhetheHD-DVD jacket for \"V for Vendetta\" from Warner Bros. Home Video. The HD edition of \"V for Vendetta\" (audio: ****, video: ****, extras: ****) just goes to prove that, no matter how many bells and whistles are hung on a DVD package, a mediocre film is still a mediocre film. But it looks gorgeous. The effects are so clean and precise, it is like viewing another medium. This can't be film - it must be something else. Even when viewed on an older set, the visuals are breathtaking. Reds are particularly dynamic. Blood spray literally pools in midair. You won't find that in \"CSI,\" by golly. At least, not yet. Director James McTeigue leads viewers through a new In-Movie experience, determined to explain changes made in Alan Moore's graphic novel, the basis for the film. \"We just didn't need another movie about a totalitarian government,\" he says. OK. So then why trifle with Moore's work? The \"experience\" drifts in and out of the running film. But you'll find new interviews with stars Natalie Portman, Hugo Weaving, producer Joel Silver and other crew members. Original extras are here, too, including a breakdown of Guy Fawkes and the Gunpowder Plot, a fascinating feature on Moore's work and the changeover in comic book plot and character styles, a director's notebook, a making-of and other bits. No one can say Warner Bros. didn't do its best with this presentation. (HD widescreen, 2006, R for strong violence and some language) - Kay Reynolds Fans of \"The Twilight Zone\" and \"Alfred Hitchcock Presents\" will find much to appreciate in \"Nightmares & Dreamscapes: From the Stories of Stephen King\" (audio: ***, video: ***1/2, extras: **). TNT assembled a wonderful cast of actors to bring King's short fiction to life. William H. Macy plays a writer who trades places with a fictional character he's created. Ron Livingston and Henry Thomas are brothers who accidentally bring about the end of the world by trying to make it a better place. And in the season's crowning achievement \"Battleground,\" William Hurt stars a hitman who must defend himself against an army of toy soldiers sent to avenge their master's murder. The episode unfolds with barely a word of dialogue spoken. TNT did a stellar job with the first season. Hopefully a second will follow. The show's eight episodes come packaged in a three disc set. Although there's no commentaries, each disc does include a few brief featurettes covering each episode. The highlight is \"Battleground Special Effects,\" which shows the ingenious ways director Brian Henson and his crew created the epic war between the miniature soldiers and Hurt. (Enhanced wide-screen, 2006, not rated) - Josh Boone The girl's got talent and it shines through on \"Hannah Montana: Livin' the Rock Star Life\" (audio: ****, video: ****, extras: **1/2). She's Miley Cyrus, yes, Billy Ray Cyrus' offspring, and she plays brunette Miley Stewart on Disney Channel. Miley's secret is she's a blonde rock star who goes by the name \"Hannah Montana,\" the show's name on Disney. This DVD features only four episodes, including one that hasn't been on TV yet, \"Money for Nothing. Guilt for Free.\" In another episode, Miley is faced with telling her best friend, Lilly, that she's Hannah. Watching Miley on the DVD bonus features, including a Hannah Montana music video, you find out what an energetic, talented 14-year-old she is, sorta like a singing Debra Messing. She seems to be taking the star thing in stride. And, she wasn't going to take \"no\" for an answer from Disney, as her audition tapes show. She kept coming back to show the channel's execs that she had what it takes to star in her own show at such a young age. (Full-screen, 2005-06, TV-G) - Toni Guagenti Call it one for the completists. Maureen O' Sullivan - the one and only Jane - was gone and Johnny Sheffield was getting sort of creepy as Boy (like Jerry Mathers after a few years as the Beaver). But \"The Tarzan Collection: Volume 2\" (audio: ***, video: ***, extras: 0) has one big thing going for it: Johnny Weissmuller. The Olympic swimmer was born to play The Ape Man; more than 50 years after he last hit the vines, he still sets the standard. The three-disc set collects six films - the second half of Weissmuller's oeuvre - and if the story lines might make Edgar Rice Burroughs wince, hey, we're still talking Tarzan. \"Tarzan Triumphs\" (1943) - The princess of a lost civilization recruits Tarzan when the Nazis arrive in the jungle. \"Tarzan's Desert Mystery\" (1943) - Searching for a malaria serum to help the Brits, our hero faces the Nazis again. \"Tarzan and the Amazons\" (1945) - Archaeologists ask T to help them find an ancient city in a hidden valley. \"Tarzan and the Leopard Woman\" (1946) - The big guy squares off with a tribe devoted to the leopard cult. \"Tarzan and the Huntress\" (1947) - A beautiful animal trainer comes to the jungle looking to stock up. Uh-oh. \"Tarzan and the Mermaids\" (1948) - Tarzan saves a young girl being forced to marry an evil pearl trader. (All full-screen, unrated) - C.A. Shapiro It's a wonderful movie, but the features leave a lot to be desired, especially since they were put together more than 15 years ago. If you don't own \"It's A Wonderful Life\" (audio: ***, video: ***, extras: **) on DVD yet, maybe it's the time to buy Paramount's repackaged 60th Anniversary Edition. If you do, skip the new owner's re-release. The movie found a market later in its life, when the studio's copyright ran out, leaving the door open for television stations to snatch it up during the holidays without paying a fee. It's the story about George Bailey and his wish to have never been born. Clarence the angel shows him what that would have been like, and that ultimately, he has a lot to live for. The extras include a \"making-of\" featurette hosted by Tom Bosley (\"Happy Days\") in 1990. His story is almost identical to the one told in another extra, \"A Personal Remembrance\" of Frank Capra and the movie narrated in 1991 by Capra's son, Frank Capra Jr. While the story behind the movie is interesting, nothing new has been added. Regardless, the movie, digitally restored and looking fresh, is a must-have for any film lover's collection. (Full-screen, 1946, not rated) Also released on DVD, \"Once Upon A Christmas\" and \"Twice Upon A Christmas\" (both: audio: ***, video: ***, extras: 0). The stories star John Dye, Kathy Ireland and Mary Donnelly Haskell in this tale about Santa Claus' two daughters and his quest to make sure the true meaning of Christmas still exists. Both are unique stories with interesting twists. (Full-screen 2000, 2001, not rated) - Toni Guagenti \"Hands Over the City\" (audio: ***1/2, video: ***, extras: ***) is a gripping, sober look at city government corruption in postwar Naples. Directed by Francesco Rosi, it is loosely based on a real building scandal and some of the stars are non-actors who were active in the real case. But there is a familiar name in the credits: Rod Steiger, who plays Eduardo Nottola, a city councilman who has a very conflicting interest in a construction company. Scandal hits when, as a result of a pile-driver being used for a new building, the adjacent old one collapses from the vibrations, killing two children and maiming another, not to mention displacing scores of families. In this 2-disc Criterion set, the extras are many and mostly all interesting. In a recent interview with Nottola, he remarks that, \"Reality can slip by us, especially political reality.\" He notes that his film requires an \"attentive and active audience.\" He also (proudly) mentions how very topical the film still is in today's Italy. The film won the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival. In an enlightening interview with an Italian film critic, he says Rosi's \"work disturbs and upsets us,\" and refers to the film as a \"fictional documentary.\" In another feature, a French critic interviews Rosi and the screenwriter, Raffaele La Capria. They discuss Rosi's typical unhappy endings to his films which, he says, \"aren't for consolation, but for stimulation.\" Filmmaker Jean-Pierre Gorin calls Rosi \"relentless\" and describes his work as the \"cinema of claustrophobia.\" Finally, \"Neopolitan Diary,\" is a 1992 feature-length sequel to \"Hands Over the City.\" Rosi returns to Naples and meets with a variety of people in a forum, some of whom, in rather dull and long-winded speeches, discuss how Naples has changed in 30 years. (Enhanced widescreen, 1963, unrated) - Peggy Earle In \"CSI: Miami - The Complete Fourth Season\" (audio: ***, video: ***, extras: ***1/2), Horatio Caine (David Caruso) and his crime scene investigators meet the Mala Noche gang, one of the most notorious on the FBI's list Caine tells his team in the season's opener. Much of the season includes dealings with the gang, which is noted for extortions, murders for hire and more - just no drug running, lest they should face deportation. The extras include a handful of commentaries that run the gamut of discussing the effects and how they make Hollywood look like Miami, the color schemes, etc., and are on a par with those from previous seasons. The bonus extras are three production featurettes taking you through preproduction, production and post, focusing mostly on one episode, \"Driven,\" so it's almost like a mini commentary. (Enhanced widescreen, 2005-06, unrated) - Bill Kelley III \"Boffo!: Tinseltown's Bombs & Blockbusters\" (audio: ***1/2, video: ***1/2, Extras: 0) sounds like its going to be an insider's look at the ups and downs of Hollywood filmmaking but instead we get 75 minutes of sanctimonious drivel from George Clooney, Morgan Freeman, Jodie Foster, Brian Grazer, Peter Bogdanovich, and many more movie biz players. The blame falls with the director of this documentary, who has some incredibly talented people willing to answer his questions and can't seem to come up with one interesting thing to ask any of them. Their answers are cliche and safe and the \"bombs\" of the title are barely mentioned at all? Where is \"Heaven's Gate\", \"Battlefield Earth\" and \"Cutthroat Island\"? (Non-enhanced widescreen, 2006, not rated) - Josh Boone",

About 300 farmers, teachers, mechanics, shopkeepers and lots of retirees were enjoying some early October sunshine and the rollicking country music of \"Cooter's Garage Band.\" As Democratic rallies go in Virginia's Republican heartland, it was \"alarmingly large,\" joked John Fry, a former Democratic chairman in Fauquier County. When the guest of honor, U.S. Senate candidate Jim Webb, arrived, a few folks drifted over to shake his hand, but most kept their distance. Later, as he spoke, the applause was respectful but not always enthusiastic. \"I see people who I know are Republicans,\" said Jones' wife, Alma Viatour. Many of them probably wouldn't have come to this Democratic rally without an invite from her husband, former TV co-star of \"The Dukes of Hazzard,\" Viatour acknowledged. But their presence spoke to unease about a faraway war, their political party's course and curiosity about Webb, not long ago a Republican himself. \"They don't like what's been going on,\" Viatour said. \"They don't want to vote for the other guy.\" As Webb's neck-and-neck contest with U.S. Sen. George Allen moves into its final days, its success might depend on the candidate's appeal to thousands of voters in rural enclaves such as \"Little Washington,\" which claims to be the first town named for America's first president. At 60, Webb has a lot in common with the voters he think s he needs. He grew up a Democrat, left the party when it turned against the Vietnam War, embraced the GOP in the Ronald Reagan era, and now - angry about the war in Iraq and Bush administration economic polices - is a Democrat reborn. \"If the Reagan Democrats will come home, both parties are going to change,\" he said. Webb's journey from Democrat to Republican and back is a complicated tale of a complex man. It is the story of a war hero who became an outspoken war skeptic, a rebel who thrived in the notoriously regimented U.S. Naval Academy and the Marine Corps, and a man of action who became wealthy writing books. Webb's political hero, Andrew Jackson, may be a good place to start the story. President from 1829 to 1837, \"Old Hickory\" was the first chief executive from the Appalachian hills that were the nation's western frontier. He was proudly unrefined, a populist champion of farmers and backwoodsmen and a foe of the bankers and aristocrats who had held sway in politics since the revolution. \"Andrew Jackson was an original,\" Webb wrote in \"Born Fighting,\" his latest book, \"an unusual and fearless leader.\" Jackson, who grew up an orphan in the Carolina hills, was the product of a Scots-Irish culture that migrated to America and took root in the Appalachians. The Scots-Irish revere military service, self-reliance and religious faith; they despise pretense and privilege. The same culture more than a century later produced Jim Webb. Webb grew up in military towns across the country and lives today with his wife, Hong Le Webb, in the comfortable Washington suburb of Falls Church. H e claims a sort of psychic home in such places as Gate City, Alley Hollow and Big Moccasin Gap in the Virginia mountains, where some of his kin still reside. In \"Born Fighting,\" Webb described \"this culture's unbending individualism - and its ingrained hatred of aristocracy.\" The Scots-Irish culture \"has been in conflict with a variety of authoritarian power structures, and it remains so in today's America,\" he wrote. Published in 2004, the book is Webb's homage to his heritage, a defense of a group he say s was indispensable to the nation's development and has been ignored, or worse, by historians and intellectuals. \"They came with nothing, and for a complicated set of reasons, many of them still have nothing,\" he wrote. \"The slurs stick to me. Rednecks. Trailer-park trash. Racists. Cannon fodder. My ancestors. My people. Me.\" Like Jackson, Webb came to prominence as a military man. The son of an Air Force officer, Webb grew up in military towns. He remembers being \"fiercely independent\" as a child and often at loggerheads with his parents. James Webb taught James Jr. to hunt and fish and love the outdoors - and introduced him to poetry. His father refused to sign permission slips when teenage Jim wanted to take up organized boxing; his mother, Vera Hodges Webb, signed instead. The elder Webb later joked that he was responsible for his son's success because young Jim rejected every piece of advice he offered. Still, there was never any question in the son's mind that he would follow his dad into the military. Webb said his grades were mediocre but he scored well on standardized tests and \"talked my way into\" a Navy ROTC scholarship at the University of Southern California. His freshman-year academics were strong enough to win admission to the Naval Academy in 1964. \"Jim was a gung-ho guy from the beginning,\" said Annapolis classmate and retired Marine Lt. Gen. Chip Gregson. Webb did well in class, particularly courses dealing with leadership, and as he had in high school, he pursued boxing. In his junior year, he fought for the brigade championship against another midshipman who would eventually go into politics: Oliver North. North was less experienced and stylistically inferior to Webb but narrowly won the fight on aggressiveness, author Robert Timberg wrote in \"The Nightingale's Song,\" a 1995 book about Webb, North and three other prominent Annapolis graduates. The two men were seen as rivals during most of their time at Annapolis, friends say. The fight's outcome still is disputed in some quarters. \"Nobody likes to lose.. I'm very competitive,\" Webb said. The Senate seat he now seeks is the one North failed to win when he ran as a Republican in 1996. That is only a coincidence, Webb said. By Webb's final year at Annapolis, as he and other midshipmen were choosing between the Navy and the Marines, much of the Class of 1968 reconsidered plans to enter the Corps. The Vietnam War was escalating, and the list of Academy grads killed or maimed seemed to grow each week. While the class failed to meet its Marine quota, Webb remained \"a Marine through and through,\" said retired Navy Capt. Gordon Peterson, another classmate. Commissioned as a second lieutenant, Webb graduated first in his class at the Corps' basic school at Quantico and arrived in South Vietnam in March 1969. \"He was just a natural as a platoon leader,\" said retired Marine Col. Mike Wyly, Webb's company commander in Vietnam. Wyly's custom was to send newcomers on night patrols. Hours after arriving at An Hoa, Webb was leading a squad into the darkness. The Marines encountered a larger group of North Vietnamese troops. Back at his command post, Wyly saw muzzle flashes, heard weapons firing, and figured Webb was a goner. But Webb called in artillery and air support, and in short order reported the enemy on the run and his squad unscathed. \"I realized I had a guy with an awful lot of talent,\" Wyly said. By the time Webb's tour ended 13 months later, he had earned two Purple Hearts, a pair of Bronze Stars, the Silver Star and the Navy Cross, the second-highest award for valor in the U.S. military. Webb earned the Cross in July 1969 when members of his company, including Wyly, stumbled into a group of enemy bunkers while searching for weapons. \"They were surrounded by us and we were surrounded by them,\" Wyly said. \"They were surprised that this happened, and I was surprised that this happened.\" As Webb approached a bunker, three enemy fighters emerged. Webb grabbed the first and other two surrendered. Webb detonated a mine at the opening of a second bunker, and then ventured inside and seized what his medal citation described as \"numerous documents containing valuable intelligence data.\" When the Marines moved to a third bunker, enemy troops rolled a grenade into their path; Webb rushed forward, firing at the enemy and using his body to shield his companions. Webb took shrapnel in his back and knee and \"probably saved my life and a lot of other people's lives,\" said Wyly, who spent 34 years in the Marines. \"I can't say that I saw anything more heroic.\" Webb's Vietnam tour ended whatever boyhood was left after Annapolis. \"I was older when I was 24 than I am now,\" he tells interviewers. Recovered from his wounds, he hoped to command Marines in battle again. But the shrapnel so damaged his knee that the Corps moved him to a desk job at the Pentagon, where his bosses included future Sen. John Warner, then an assistant secretary of the Navy. Webb stayed for two years before leaving, frustrated at being away from the field, then left the Corps for Georgetown University law school in 1972. Webb said he was stunned to find a student culture that opposed the war and was contemptuous of those who fought it. His time at Georgetown stoked a rage that Webb said didn't dissipate until Sept. 11, 2001. \"The strategy of the war deserved no prizes,\" Webb says today. He had no quarrel with those who opposed U.S. involvement in Vietnam. \"I only had a problem when they turned on the people who served.\" A classmate urged him to support fellow Annapolis man Jimmy Carter in the 1976 presidential election, but Timberg writes that Webb was repulsed by Carter's plan to grant amnesty to Vietnam War-era draft evaders. He migrated to the GOP. Webb said he was particularly attracted to Ronald Reagan. He later served Reagan in the 1980s as assistant secretary of defense for reserve affairs and then secretary of the Navy. He quit the secretary post after 10 months in 1987 after disagreeing with Navy cutbacks. By the mid-1970s, Webb had begun writing, mostly articles for military journals. \"Writing has probably defined me more than any other thing that I've done,\" he said recently. In 1979, he caused a stir - one that still reverberates today in his Senate campaign - with a Washingtonian magazine article titled \"Women Can't Fight.\" It reflected his belief that the admission of women into the Naval Academy diminished the school's preparation of combat leaders. The article also highlighted his view that leaders were putting political correctness ahead of national defense. Webb has apologized repeatedly this year for much of the article's language, particularly his assertion that the mostly male brigade was \"a horny woman's dream.\" But he has never completely backed away from its central argument - that the Academy produced better combat leaders when it was all-male. A year before Webb wrote the controversial article, he published his first novel. He struggled through seven full drafts of a Vietnam novel, \"Fields of Fire.\" The book was rejected by 13 printing houses before being published by Prentice-Hall in 1978 to critical acclaim. Webb has since written five more novels, all with military themes, as well as several screenplays. \"Fields of Fire\" stands as his biggest success. The book is an unflinching account of the daily horror of battle, told from the viewpoint of the men who fought it. \"It was a way for me to assimilate that experience, to put it in the right place in my life,\" Webb said. A key character in the book is Will Goodrich, who leaves Harvard to become a Marine. He loses a leg in battle and returns to college, then is shattered to find himself branded a killer by rich kids who'd ducked the draft. The book ends with Goodrich speaking at an antiwar rally and turning on his classmates. Webb put the scolding in capital letters. \"HOW MANY OF YOU ARE GOING TO GET HURT IN VIETNAM? I DIDN'T SEE ANY OF YOU IN VIETNAM. I SAW DUDES MAN. DUDES AND TRUCK DRIVERS AND COAL MINERS AND FARMERS. I DIDN'T SEE YOU. WHERE WERE YOU? \" The book established Webb as an author and as a spokesman for Vietnam War vets. His advocacy led Webb in 1982 to a leadership role in developing the Vietnam Veterans Memorial on the National Mall - and a bitter public fight over its design. Webb saw the original proposal - a black granite wall inscribed with the names of war dead - as an insult to those who fought. At his insistence, a statue of three battle-weary troops was placed near the memorial's entrance with an inscription recognizing \"the courage, sacrifice and devotion to duty and country\" of Vietnam War vet s. Webb \"always looked after his people,\" said Dale Wilson, a North Carolina businessman and former Marine who lost both legs and an arm while serving with Webb. Wilson is among the old comrades Webb still checks on, 37 years after their tour. In the mid-1990s, when Wilson was ill with a mysterious abdominal ailment, Webb arranged to have him brought to the Navy's medical center in Bethesda, Md., where specialists fixed a dangerous arterial blockage. Wilson said he couldn't have navigated the Navy bureaucracy without Webb. \"Jim's always been there.\" Webb said, \"I watched a generation of people I served with, and I saw what happened to them.. The majority of them have gotten screwed.\" For years, Webb's passion for military service was matched by contempt for people such as former President Clinton, who spent the Vietnam War years at toney schools and took pains to avoid the military. But when the terrorist attacks came Sept. 11, 2001, Webb said that, for him, the wall that separated those who protested the Vietnam War and those who fought it came down. Webb said he wants to put Vietnam aside and make alliances with those who share his concern about Iraq. \"What's going on now is so much more important,\" he said. Clinton and his wife, New York Sen. Hillary Clinton, have campaigned for Webb this month. His objections to the current war are consistent with his long-held feelings about the compact between soldiers and their civilian leaders. During a 1990 speech at the Confederate Memorial at Arlington National Cemetery, Webb foreshadowed his opposition. \"There are at least two lessons for us to take away from such a day of remembrance,\" Webb said at that ceremony. \"The first is one our leaders should carry next to their breasts and contemplate every time they face a crisis.. It is simply this: You hold our soldiers' lives in sacred trust. When a citizen has sworn to obey you, and follow your judgment, and walk onto a battlefield to defend the interests you define as worthy of his blood, do not abuse that awesome power through careless policy, unclear objectives or inflexible leadership. \"The second lesson regards those who have taken such an oath and who have honored the judgment of their leaders, often at great cost. Intellectual analyses of national policy are subject to constant re-evaluation by historians as the decades roll by, but duty is a constant, frozen in the context of the moment it was performed.\" Webb said he went to war willingly and was proud to serve, as his family has always done. He groomed his son to do the same, taking the boy to former battlefields around the world, including Afghanistan and Vietnam. James Robert Webb, now serving in Iraq, joined the Marines. On the campaign trail, Webb wears combat boots to honor his son but deflects queries about Jimmy Webb's whereabouts and welfare. \"I can't talk about it,\" he said. The sometimes self-righteous tone of his writings, along with his battles over the Vietnam Veterans Memorial and the budget struggle that caused him to resign as Navy secretary, have led some to wonder whether Webb could manage the compromises that are part of Senate life. Retired Marine Maj. Gen. Terry Murray said Webb \"would have some challenges\" in the Senate. Murray is a Webb friend and Annapolis classmate who had served as the Corps' Senate liaison. Former Nebraska Sen. Bob Kerrey, who earned the Medal of Honor in Vietnam and helped persuade Webb to run, said the Democrat will come to Senate debates \"knowing what he thinks ought to be done. \" \"Before you can find common ground, you have to know what you believe,\" said Kerrey. Through the years, Webb said, he think s his writings have had some impact on national security debates. In 2005, though, he concluded that the issues of economic fairness - his concern that many Americans are being left behind as the country advances - can be addressed only from inside government. In February, he became a candidate. \"Today, we risk being cut away from our government, from our democracy,\" Webb told an Alexandria crowd last month. Republican \"slash-and-burn politics. have too often obscured the real issues for America.. \"In a democracy, we are the boss. And George Allen and George Bush work for us. And the more people they can scare away or turn away from politics, the fewer bosses they're having. They don't want participation. They want to just move along with the status quo, lining the pockets of their corporate friends, protecting their own, while YOUR job goes overseas and your kid goes to Iraq.\" The words were delivered with a passion Webb often seems to suppress on the campaign trail, and the Democratic audience whooped its approval. Webb, who early in his campaign wouldn't approach strangers for fear of invading their space, acknowledges that politicking hasn't come easily. \"There's so much crap in politics,\" Webb said, and the \"traditional methodology. is something I've never apprenticed for.\" \"I think I know how to cooperate and I know how to work across party lines,\" he said, noting that he spent four years after law school as a staff lawyer in the House. If he wins, he said, \"the people who put me there are going to get six years of really innovative thought and willingness to confront the status quo.\" And if not? After fathering four children - one with his first wife, Barbara Samorajczyk, and three with his second wife, JoAnn Krukar Webb, a former Army nurse who is campaigning for him - Webb is about to become a dad again. Hong Webb, a Vietnam native and securities lawyer he met in the 1990s and married last year, is pregnant and due to deliver in December. During his first time around, Webb was \"a very engaged father\" whose writing career gave him plenty of freedom to spend time with his family, said Amy Hogan, at 36 Webb's eldest child and now a mother of three. He was a disciplinarian, with \"a famous look that can crack a rock,\" she said, but he also has humorous streak. It has been 21 years since Webb last became a father, but the prospect of night feedings and diaper changes is not at all intimidating, he insisted. \"I still know who I am, and I still have a life.\" Reach Dale Eisman at or",

                "text": "No. 1 Oscar Smith at King's Fork Records: Oscar Smith 7-0 overall, 5-0 Southeastern District; King's Fork 3-4, 2-3 The lowdown: Oscar Smith pounded previously unbeaten Deep Creek last week for its 31st consecutive regular-season victory. The Tigers haven't missed a beat with backup QB Phillip Sims, a freshman, subbing for an injured Dexter Merritt. Sims has thrown for 633 yards and 10 TDs in his three starts, and he's expected to be behind center tonight as Merritt's knee continues to heal. King's Fork has taken grand strides in its third season, winning three of its past four games. The Bulldogs' defense ranks among South Hampton Roads' top 10 in total defense and points allowed. Jami says: Make it 32. Oscar Smith, 35-7. Larry says: Can anyone give the Tigers a game? Oscar Smith, 31-0. No. 6 Deep Creek vs. Great Bridge Site: Colon L. Hall Stadium (behind Great Bridge Middle School) Records: Deep Creek 6-1 overall, 4-1 Southeastern District; Great Bridge 3-4, 2-4 The lowdown: Deep Creek is coming off its first shutout loss since 1993 - a 35-0 spanking by Oscar Smith. The Hornets totaled minus-10 rushing yards. Deep Creek has three victories by seven points or less. Great Bridge boasts South Hampton Roads' passing leader, QB Casey Turner, who has 1,802 yards and 15 TDs. Turner last week hit six receivers, including two who hadn't caught a pass this season. David Reynolds leads the Wildcats - and the Southeastern District - with 35 receptions for 490 yards. Great Bridge's biggest obstacle could be history. The Wildcats have lost 13 consecutive games in the series, a streak that dates to 1992. Jami says: It's about time. Great Bridge, 28-27. Larry says: But not tonight. Deep Creek, 34-28. No. 7 Tallwood at Ocean Lakes Records: Tallwood 6-1 overall and Beach District, Ocean Lakes 3-4 The lowdown: Tallwood has won four consecutive games to stay in the Beach District title hunt, though the Lions struggled in a 6-3 victory last week over one-win Cox. The Lions' defense hasn't surrendered more than a touchdown since a 14-9 loss to Bayside in mid-September, and this is a tricky game since unbeaten Salem looms next week. Ocean Lakes' season has spiraled away, thanks mostly to injuries. The Dolphins have lost four of their past five games. Star RB Roy Banks is banged up and managed just 35 yards in last week's loss to Bayside. But do-everything junior Marcus Davis, who usually plays receiver but also plays some quarterback and returns kicks, rushed for 116 yards last Friday. Jami says: Can the Lions prove me wrong (again)? Ocean Lakes, 13-10. Larry says: Lions fans are going to love you. Tallwood, 27-20. No. 5 Lake Taylor at Booker T. Washington Records: Lake Taylor 6-1 overall, 4-1 Eastern District; Booker T. Washington 1-6, 1-3 The lowdown: Lake Taylor is coming off a bye and has won three consecutive games since a loss to Maury. The Titans are in good shape to make the Division 5 playoffs but need to win this one and finish with victories over Churchland and Norview. RB George McInnis leads Lake Taylor with 781 yards. Booker T. Washington has lost three straight and is headed for its worst season since going 2-8 in 2000. The Bookers had won four consecutive games against Lake Taylor before last year's 48-14 loss. Jami says: Titans \"run\" away with this one. Lake Taylor, 26-7. Larry says: It has been a long season for the Bookers. Lake Taylor, 37-13. Nansemond River at No. 8 Hickory Records: Nansemond River 2-6 overall, 1-5 Southeastern District; Hickory 4-3, 3-2 The lowdown: Nansemond River is coming off its fifth consecutive loss, and four of them have been by 17 points or more. Warriors RB Jamar Jarrell has 585 rushing yards and leads the Southeastern District. If he holds on, he'll be the first Suffolk player to lead the district in rushing since Nansemond River's Trayce McPherson in 2003. All three of Hickory's losses have been by a touchdown or less, but none has hurt more than last week's five-overtime defeat to Western Branch. That loss doomed the Hawks' playoff chances. Hickory QB Brian Inghram has thrown for 727 yards and nine TDs, and he's on pace to become the Hawks' first 1,000-yard passer since Adrian Vega amassed 1,163 in 2001. Jami says: Hawks still have fight in them. Hickory, 31-13. Larry says: Hawks take out their frustrations. Hickory, 36-0. Kellam at Cox Records: Kellam 5-2 overall and Beach District, Cox 1-6 The lowdown: Kellam has climbed back up the Beach District standings with back-to-back victories, including 29-27 last week against Kempsville, and the Knights still have a chance to make the playoffs if they win out. Kellam leads the district in rushing, averaging 227.7 yards per game, and Javon Boddie has totaled 605 and nine TDs. Cox has lost three of its past four games but nearly shocked Tallwood last week. That 6-3 loss followed an eight-point loss to Bayside. Jami says: Kellam, 28-7. Larry says: Kellam, 27-14. First Colonial at Green Run Records: First Colonial 3-4 overall and Beach District, Green Run 1-7 The lowdown: First Colonial's promising season has gone south with back-to-back losses, including 31-9 last week to Landstown. Patriots RB Tony Gregory has rushed for 519 yards and seven TDs. Green Run has lost four straight games, scoring 12 points or less in each of them. Jami says: First Colonial, 20-6. Larry says: First Colonial, 26-20. Kempsville at Princess Anne Records: Kempsville 3-5 overall and Beach District, Princess Anne 0-7 The lowdown: Kempsville has lost three games by 10 points or less, including 29-27 last week to Kellam. The Chiefs' Kevin Simmons is engaged in a battle for the Beach District rushing lead and should pad his 24-yard edge over Salem's Kevin Whaley. Princess Anne, coming off its bye week, has lost 12 in a row dating to last season. Jami says: Kempsville, 35-0. Larry says: Kempsville, 31-0. Wilson vs. Granby Site: Powhatan Field Records: Wilson 0-7 overall, 0-4 Eastern District; Granby 0-7, 0-4 The lowdown: The winner stays out of the Eastern District basement, with the loser likely heading for a winless season. Wilson has lost 17 in a row. Granby is on a nine-game losing streak, with its last victory being 53-0 against the Presidents in 2005. Wilson's 14 points last Friday against King's Fork were a season high. Granby has scored seven points total in its past three games. Jami says: Granby, 8-6. Larry says: Granby, 20-6. Norcom at Lakeland Records: Norcom 2-5, Lakeland 0-7 The lowdown: Norcom lost a heart-breaker last week, 16-13 against Churchland, on a late field goal. Greyhounds QB Cameron White and WR Michael Hines have hooked up for 370 yards. Lakeland has lost 17 consecutive games and hasn't scored more than a touchdown in this non-district series since 2002. Jami says: Greyhounds eyeing .500. Norcom, 29-7. Larry says: No close calls this time. Norcom, 26-13. Southampton Academy at Isle of Wight Academy Time: 7:30 p.m. Records: Southampton Academy 7-1, Isle of Wight Academy 7-1 The lowdown: These rivals hook up in a game that matches two of the top teams in VIS Division III. Isle of Wight is ranked No. 2, but the Chargers are coming off a one-point loss to Blessed Sacrament. Huguenot Southampton Academy is ranked third and has won five consecutive games since a loss to Fuqua. Isle of Wight defeated Fuqua this season. The Chargers blanked Southampton Academy 33-0 late last season - the Raiders' first back in 11-man football - on their way to a state title. Jami says: Isle of Wight Academy, 42-28. Larry says: Isle of Wight Academy, 33-23. Blue Ridge School at Nansemond-Suffolk Records: Blue Ridge 5-2, Nansemond-Suffolk Academy 2-6 The lowdown: Nansemond-Suffolk snapped a three-game losing streak by trouncing Greenbrier Christian 43-17 last week. The Saints piled up 309 total yards and easily surpassed their season-high in scoring after totaling seven points in their previous three games. Blue Ridge, ranked fifth in VIS Division II, is coming off a 32-29 victory over previously unbeaten Virginia Episcopal. QB Chad Byers threw for 212 yards and kicked the game-winning 26-yard field goal with five seconds left. Jami says: Blue Ridge, 21-10. Larry says: Blue Ridge, 17-13. Bishop Sullivan Catholic at Hampton Christian Records: Bishop Sullivan Catholic 2-7, Hampton Christian 1-5 The lowdown: Hold that season finale talk. The Crusaders added two more games to their original schedule - this one and a 2 p.m. home game Nov. 4 against Nativity of Pennsylvania. The Crusaders have lost three in a row. Hampton Christian, playing in its second season of varsity football, defeated Norfolk Christian 35-21 three weeks ago. Jami says: Bishop Sullivan, 28-14. Larry says: Bishop Sullivan, 27-20. Greenbrier Christian at Brunswick Academy Records: Greenbrier Christian 2-5, Brunswick Academy 3-5 The lowdown: Greenbrier Christian has lost four of its past five games and lost 26-0 to Brunswick Academy last season. Gators QB Josh Healey accounted for 200 yards of offense and both TDs in last week's loss to Nansemond-Suffolk. Jami says: Brunswick Academy, 18-16. Larry says: Brunswick Academy, 23-17. Also: Tidewater Academy (0-7) at Kenston Forest (2-7), 7:30 p.m. Jami says: Kenston Forest, 27-8. Larry says: Kenston Forest, 31-13. Windsor (3-5 overall, 1-1 Tri-Rivers District) at Surry (3-3, 0-1) Jami says: Windsor, 25-16. Larry says: Windsor, 22-18. Northampton (4-4) at Franklin (5-2) Jami says: Franklin, 22-20. Larry says: Franklin, 34-16. Poquoson (0-7 overall, 0-6 Bay Rivers District) at Smithfield (6-1, 5-1), 7:30 p.m. Jami says: Smithfield, 35-7. Larry says: Smithfield, 33-12. York (2-5 overall, 1-5 Bay Rivers District) at Southampton (5-2, 4-2), 7:30 p.m. Jami says: Southampton, 30-14. Larry says: Southampton, 27-15.",

                "text": "\"Fast Times at Ridgemont High\" \"Army of Darkness\" Both films offer laughs, although each might appeal to different tastes. \"Fast Times at Ridgemont High\" follows a group of 80's-era high school students growing fast up in California. It's based on the book by Cameron Crowe, who wrote and directed \"Jerry McQuire\" and \"Elizabethtown.\" Amy Hecklerling, the director/writer of \"Clueless,\" directs here. Crowe and Heckerling pair up for commentary that tells us who else was in the running for lead roles. They also share plenty of Sean Penn stories. Penn, who played stoned surfer Jeff Spicoli, stayed so in character, he would only respond to \"Jeff\" on set and off. Commentary suggests that wasn't as much fun in real life as it sounds. But you might have heard all this before. Commentary and extras, good as they are, are no different from the Special Edition DVD released in 2004. As a matter of fact, you'll have to flip the HD disc to the standard DVD side to pick up the extras. \"Army of Darkness\" didn't even fare that well; a theatrical trailer is the lone extra. The \"Director's Cut,\" released in 2000, contained terrific commentary from writer/director Sam \"Spiderman\" Raimi and the film's wonderfully weird star, Bruce Campbell. There was also 15 minutes of additional footage and an alternate ending. Even more extras can be found on the \"Special Edition\" released in 1999. So hang on to those jewels if you've got them. \"Army of Darkness\" is the third film in Raimi's \"Evil Dead\" series of low budget horror flicks and looks superb in HD. Campbell returns as chainsaw and shotgun wielding Ash, the valiant S-Mart clerk. Ash finds himself transported back to medieval times where, once again, he must battle the undead. But somehow the horror dissolves into a Three Stooges-rolled-into-one comedy fiasco complete with Ray Harryhousen-like effects. There's never been anything like \"Army of Darkness\" or Ash. (Both: HD widescreen. \"Army of Darkness\": 1993, rated R for violence and horror. \"Fast Times at Ridgemont High\": 1982, rated R for sex, nudity, language and drug use) Kay Reynolds The wonder teens of Newport, Calif., are back in \"The O.C.: The Complete Third Season,\" (audio: ****, video: ***1/2, extras: ***) but not all of them will make it back for fourth-season premiere on Fox in November. If you didn't see the fantastical ending of season three, buy the box set, or at least borrow it to find out what happens. The season's begins with Kirsten in rehab, Marissa and Ryan and Seth and Summer all snuggly-wuggly, and Julie trying to make another go with ex-hubby, Jimmy. Of course, as each hour-episode unfolds, the couples' bliss is short-lived, and someone always is stirring the pot Kaitlin Cooper, Julie's daughter and Marissa's sister, for one. The special features on this seven-disc set are mostly worth watching, whether you're a teen or not. There's the hackneyed making-of video for \"The Subways,\" performing at The Bait Shop, and there's a gag reel, where it's fun to watch Adam Brody (Seth) and Peter Gallagher (Sandy) mess up; they're funny guys. The real gems on this set include creator/writer Josh Schwartz and a pair of executive producers/writers actually using a remote control to scan through two episodes, \"The Undertow\" and \"The Pot Stirrer.\" During \"The Undertow,\" Schwartz explains how he demanded writer J.J. Philbin write sex scenes for each couple in the show. The two share laughs over that. In another feature, \"The Party Favor: From Script to Screen,\" the viewer gets to see how episode No. 23 about prom is made from the screenplay writing to the editing room. Now we can see how the editor put together the big fight between Ryan and Volchok, and watch Summer's stunt-double take a fall for Rachel Bilson. The other great feature on disc five, \"What's in a Name?\", is also worth a look. Schwartz and others on the show tell how they've used people in their lives and stolen names for O.C. characters. The interviews with the people who get the \"shout outs\" on the show, those fleeting 15 minutes of fame, are funny and honest. (Enhanced widescreen, 2005-06, not rated) Toni Guagenti At 78 minutes, \"Looking for Kitty\" (audio: **1/2, video: **1/2, extras: **1/2), is yet another thin and unremarkable effort from writer/director/actor Edward Burns, who has made a career following the romantic troubles of sad sacks in New York City. \"Kitty,\" which has been on the shelf for two years, was shot for $200 grand on digital video. It stars Burns as an incompetent private eye who agrees to help a high school baseball coach (\"Numb3rs\" star David Krumholtz) find his wife who has left him for a rock star. Burns contributes an intelligent commentary, sharing tidbits about the low budget production that should interest budding filmmakers. Also included is an alternate opening. Worth a rental only if you're a Burns fan. (Enhanced wide-screen, 2006, Rated R for language and some sexual references) Josh Boone Remember the theme song \"They're creepy and they're kooky, mysterious and ooky. They're altogether spooky The Addams Family\"? If you don't, you can join in the karaoke sing-along with Thing, found among the extras of \"The Addams Family: Volume One\" (audio: ***, video: ***, extras: ****). Twenty-two of the black and white episodes, based on the macabre cartoons of Charles Addams, are available on a 3-flip-disc set. It's nice to see how the creator is remembered here, particularly in the documentary, \"You Rang, Mr. Addams?\" Initially, Addams created cartoons around a variety of characters. Some the basis for Morticia, Gomez, Uncle Fester, Lurch, Wednesday and Pugsley began to appear again and again, falling into a ghoulish \"family\" motif. When Addams was approached by MGM to develop his work into a series, he had to finally name and describe them. Lisa Loring, Ken Weathermax and Felix Silla, who played Wednesday, Pugsley and Cousin Itt, provide commentary and interviews, along with Stephen Cox, author of \"The Addams Chronicles.\" John Astin (Gomez) also shows up for interviews. Vic Mizzy, who wrote the memorable theme and other Addams' mood music, has his own featurette to tell us how he did it. Aside from the annoying flip-discs, this is a great presentation for a unique and well-loved family sit-com. (Fullscreen, black & white, 1964, not rated) Kay Reynolds - Sometimes you just have to buy an entire series on DVD in hopes that the extras will get better or be included on the discs; \"Wings: The Complete Third Season\" (audio: ***1/2, video: ***1/2, extras: 0) is one of those shows. This season brings Helen (Crystal Bernard) back to Nantucket to contend with Joe's new girlfriend. Of course, that can't last the entire season, so the viewer cheers Helen on, not only to get back with Joe, but to become the accomplished, recognized cellist she dreams of becoming. Oh, first, she has to marry Antonio (Tony Shalhoub). Laughs are abundant in all 22 season three episodes. \"Wings\" spawned some talented actors, including Shalhoub (\"Monk\"), Thomas Haden Church (\"Sideways\") and Tim Daly (\"Sopranos\"). They're out there, CBS Paramount, so go find them and get them to do special features, commentary, anything. We'll wait for subsequent seasons on DVD to see how that turns out. (Fullscreen, 1991-92, not rated) Toni Guagenti Can you say \"parody\"? Well if you can, \"Greg the Bunny: Best of Film Parodies\" (audio: ***, video: ***, extras: ***) is for you. The Independent Film Channel's cult favorite comes in a two-DVD set that contains 14 episodes of parodies of classic films such as, \"Pulp Fiction,\" \"Easy Rider\" and \"The Godfather\" among others. Most of the approximately 15-minute episodes are funny and stand up well enough on their own. You needn't to have seen \"Fargo\" with its infamous woodchipper, or \"Miller's Crossing\" or even \"Auto Focus\" to enjoy \"Sex, Button Eyes, and a Video Ape,\" which charts Greg's Bob Crane-like descent into homemade video porn addiction. But it does help to be well-versed in some form of \"filmography\" to FULLY enjoy what those crazy, perverse puppets Greg, Warren and Count Blah are serving up in this DVD set. Please note: This is not the Fox sitcom, which was cancelled before the show made its way to IFC. This is not for the family. Extras include commentaries on all 14 episodes by the show's creators; a \"gag\" reel; photo galleries; two featurettes and some deleted scenes. These parodies are out of the box. No strings attached. (Fullscreen, 1, not rated, Includes scenes of graphic violence, illegal drug use, nudity.and some puppet sex) Cliff Redding Politics and passion are the topics for two of Docurama's latest DVD offerings. Despite being released in 2004, both are timely but only one makes a real impact. The title subject in the surprisingly engaging \"The Education of Shelby Knox: Sex, Lies and Education\" (audio: ***1/2, video: ***, extras: 0), is an idealistic teen from Lubbock, Texas, a city that in 2002 had some of the highest rates of STDs in the country. Pledged to wait for sex until marriage by her church, she still bristles at the disconnect between the school district's abstinence-only policy and her pregnant classmates. With the wary support of her conservative parents, Knox joins the fledgling Lubbock Youth Commission in the hopes of winning an audience with the school board. The road she walks against lay ministers and board members devoted to Bible teachings is daunting, but her biggest problem may be Corey, a fellow committee member/political aspirant who quickly learns to color inside the lines. When gay students try to also get a fair hearing and the Youth Commission shies away from them, Knox defends them. Her conviction to uncover the answers that the Bible doesn't provide her will inspire you, regardless of which side you come down on. Tying it all together at the documentary's end is a timely epilogue, one which demonstrates how politics and religious hypocrisy continue at times to make comfortable bedfellows. (Fullscreen, 2004, not rated, but nothing objectionable) It was a few weeks after 9/11, and New York filmmaker Nina Davenport was finishing a freelance job in San Diego. Afraid to fly home, she had an inspired idea: take a cross-country trip to document the mood of the country after the Twin Towers fell.",

At first, they're scared of the tall, foreboding bush, which they call \"Steve\" for lack of a better name, until R.J. the raccoon (Bruce Willis) shows them the utopia in suburbia. The movie, based on the popular cartoon of the same name, is smartly written and has wonderful computer animation a glimpse of which you get in the extra features. Not only is the story fun, but the DVD is packed with great extras including a couple not-so-easy games, such as the Skee-Ball-like Hammy Nut Toss. Commentary by directors Tim Johnson, Karey Kirkpatrick and producer Bonnie Arnold shows their pride in the whole package, from which effects were the hardest to animate to some of Thomas Haden Church's ad-libs as exterminator Dwayne. Other extras worth watching include a new animated short, \"Hammy's Boomerang Adventure,\" \"Dwayne's Verm-Tech Infomercial\" and a look at the actors who do the voices, including Portsmouth's own Wanda Sykes as Stella the skunk. (Enhanced widescreen, 2006, rated PG for some rude humor and mild comic action) Toni Guagenti Inline image:VirginianPilot-tHD-DVD/DVD comb disc jacket for \"The Break-Up\" from Universal Studios Home Entertainment. In brief, \"The Break-Up\" (audio, ***, video: ***1/2, extras: ****) is \"Swingers\" revisited. So if you're looking for light, romantic comedy, this isn't it. But if you want a blend of comedy and drama and don't mind revisiting some dialogues . you may have had in the past, then spend time with Vince Vaughn, Jennifer Aniston and the splendid cast including Jon Favreau, Jason Bateman, Joey Lauren Adams and Vincent D'Onofrio that plays their family and friends. Viewers will find conflict as soon as the DVD and HD-DVD opens. You'll get to pick a \"his side\" or \"her side\" to watch the film. It's the same movie no matter what you pick, but can't you picture couples fighting for the remote? Vaughn co-wrote and produced the film and provides an in-depth commentary. Aniston is also featured, although she's strictly support. A second commentary with director Peyton Reed is also worthwhile. But what truly makes the DVD worth its price is an alternate ending, similar to the theater version, except that it also features the hilarious Tone Rangers and their leader, John Michael Higgins. The HD version of \"Break-Up\" brings a bigger pop in picture and sound. It also has the \"U Control\" feature that allows viewers to watch highlights from the extras as the film runs. Make sure you're up-to-date with the latest firmware software (2.0 version) for your Toshiba HD-DVD player, to use the U Control feature. (HD widescreen & enhanced widescreen, 2006, rated PG-13 for sexual content, some nudity and language) Kay Reynolds Inline image:VirginianPilot-tDVD jacket for \"Feast:Unrated\" from The Weinstein Company. \"Feast\" (audio:***, video:***, extras:**1/2) is the third film born from the reality television series \"Project Greenlight,\" spearheaded by Ben Affleck, Matt Damon and Chris Moore. While the show is terrific, the resulting films have been lackluster straight-to-video fare. With the threat of cancellation looming, the third season was devoted to making a commercially viable horror film, and the filmmakers may have succeeded. This unrated edition of \"Feast,\" a loud and predictable monster movie, should sell and rent well on DVD. Extras include a commentary with director John Gulager, producers Mike Leahy and Joel Soisson, writers Marcus Dunstan and Patrick Melton, and creature and makeup effects designer Garry Tunnicliffe. Deleted scenes and two brief promotional featurettes are also on display. The show that spawned \"Feast\" may not fare quite so well. Although the previous two seasons were released on DVD simultaneously with their featured movie, the third season of \"Greenlight\" is has yet to see the light of day, and at present, the show has not been picked up for a fourth season. (Enhanced widescreen, 2006, unrated) Josh Boone Inline image:VirginianPilot-t Is it blasphemy to remake a classic film? Maybe if we were talking about \"Casablanca.\" Making a hands-off case for \"The Omen\" (audio, ***, video, ***1/2, extras, ****) isn't as easy. The original, directed by Richard Donner and starring Gregory Peck and Lee Remick as the duped parents, was released in 1976. Honestly, it was difficult to believe that Peck so well known for his role as Atticus Finch in \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" could be thwarted by the devil's child. Would Peck/Finch lie to his wife about replacing their baby? Take us up to 2006 with a new cast and the plot is easier to swallow. So are the new, state of the art visual effects. Director John Moore, who also filmed the remake of \"Flight of the Phoenix,\" was visited by the \"Omen\" curse while rushing the film for release on June 6, 2006 all the better to take advantage of \"Number of the Beast\" tie in. Viewers can get the details in Moore's commentary and in a featurette, \"Omenisms.\" Additional supernatural lore is explored in \"Revelation 666,\" but it's a choppy piece no pun intended. You'll find better on The Discovery and Sci-Fi channels. An additional feature on the score, deleted and extended scenes, with commentary, round out the standard extras for decent Halloween party viewing. The film is a near scene-for-scene remake. It's the cast, including Liev Schreiber, Julia Stiles, Pete Postlethwaite, David Thewlis and a particularly scary little boy, Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick, who'll hold your interest. Mia Farrow shows up, too, as an especially protective nanny who would be perfect in a \"Halloween\"-type remake of \"Mary Poppins.\" (Enhanced widescreen, 2006, rated for disturbing violent content, graphic images and some language) Kay Reynolds Inline image:VirginianPilot-t During the turbulent 1960s, an unwritten rule dominated college basketball in Texas. You never play more than one black basketball player at home. Two if you're on the road and three only if you're losing. Coach Don Haskins (Josh Lucas) at tiny Texas Western University in El Paso wanted to win and that meant bucking the system. After searching far and wide, Haskins selected seven African-American players, mostly from north of the Mason-Dixon Line. By season's end, Texas Western made it to a national championship and defeated an all-white Kentucky team under legendary coach Adolph Rupp. NBA coach and Kentucky guard Pat Riley calls the victory the \"emancipation proclamation of 1966\" during an interview at the closing credits. The inspirational \"Glory Road\" (audio: ****, video: ****, extras: **) shines in high-def Blu-ray, with a spectacular picture and uncompressed digital sound, but Disney shortchanged the extras. Two documentaries featured on the low-tech DVD have vanished, one that highlighted Haskins' 30-year-plus career, the other that included interviews with his players and colleagues. Two commentaries are intact, including one with first-time director James Gartner, handpicked by producer Jerry Bruckheimer. Gartner is quite open about his shortcomings, wishing he had tightened a few scenes, but details the racial tension on-screen in scenes with Bobby Joe Hill (Derek Luke). \"Luke's character is full of quiet anger, as benched talent,\" Gartner says, since most black players of his era never saw action in the South. (HD widescreen, 2006, PG for racial issues including violence and epithets, and momentary language) Samsung Blu-ray player update: The first firmware software download is available at () to correct issues that have plagued the player since its launch in June minus the fix for the slightly soft picture. That will be addressed in the next version. Here's the list of fixes with firmware 1.0v (DTS sound causing image jitter, improved loading time, correct analog outputs if reversed, and 4:3 pillarboxing for BD content) - Bill Kelley III Paul Weitz, the writer and director of \"In Good Company,\" satirizes both \"American Idol\" and George Bush's presidency in \"American Dreamz\" (audio:***1/2, video:***1/2, extras:***), a film that succeeds as often as it fails. Hugh Grant plays the Simon Cowell-esque host, Mandy Moore plays the camera-loving idol, and Dennis Quaid plays the bumbling Bush clone who serves as guest judge on the \"American Idol\" stand-in \"American Dreamz\" to raise his falling numbers with voters. Weitz insists he wrote the script before ever watching \"American Idol,\" something very hard to believe. Extras include a commentary with Weitz and actor Sam Golzari (who has the best role in the film as a sleeper cell terrorist who would rather dance and sing than kill anyone), deleted scenes, and two brief featurettes. (Enhanced wide-screen, 2006, rated PG-13 for brief strong language and some sexual references) Josh Boone Watch your back or get got. That was the way of life for some in Bed-Stuy in the '80s. (That's the Brooklyn neighborhood of Bedford-Stuyvesant, for those not up on New York lingo.) Comedian Chris Rock weaves tales from his childhood in New York in his sitcom \"Everybody Hates Chris: The First Season\" (audio: ***, video: ***, extras: ****). Tichina Arnold, Terry Crews, Imani Hakim and Tequan Richmond star. Tyler James Williams stars as Chris. Executive producer and co-creator Ali LeRoi shares the science of casting in the DVD extras. Williams, a fairly unknown actor before the show, was a perfect fit because the audience could get to know him as Chris. Better than that, Williams was a real 13-year-old boy, awkwardness and all. Hakim, a Cleveland native, makes the perfect little sister because she looks like an ordinary neighborhood kid. \"I was happy because I came out of the ghetto and got this part,\" Hakim says in the extras. And Richmond just has that cooler younger brother look, Rock and LeRoi said. The comedy is loosely based on Rock's life, but it's no autobiography. Rock really has six brothers and one sister. On the show, he has two siblings. \"There's a portion of the show that reflects Chris' life, and it's really in the tone,\" LeRoi said. The 22-episode DVD release also includes cast and crew commentaries on select episodes, featurettes, bloopers, deleted scenes, set photos and audition reels. It's comedy and Chris Rock is involved, so of course, it's lots of fun. (Enhanced widescreen, 2005-06. not rated) DeAnne M. Bradley Although the Mormon Church banned polygamy in 1890, at least 40,000 people are thought to practice it and more may be watching it on cable. HBO continues its tradition of delivering the finest dramatic shows on television with \"Big Love: The Complete First Season\" (audio: ***1/2, video: ***1/2, extras: **1/2), an even-handed look at modern-day polygamy in Salt Lake City. Bill Paxton stars as the head of the family with three beautiful wives (Jeanne Tripplehorn, Chloe Sevigny, Ginnifer Goodwin), seven kids, and a thriving business. He has all the trouble three families would bring three mortgages, warring personalities, sexual dysfunction, and more. Harry Dean Stanton steals the show as the creepy backwoods patriarch of a polygamist commune. As is always the case with HBO, this five-disc set containing 12 episodes will run you a very steep $100. Extras are also thin for a set this highly priced. Three commentaries and a brief look at the creation of the opening title sequence are all viewers have to chew on. But if you want the best, you have to pay the price. (Enhanced wide-screen, 2006, unrated) - Josh Boone Eloise is an imp with a heart and her personality shines through on IDT Entertainment's new line of animated stories, including the new releases \"Me, Eloise\" and \"Eloise: Little Miss Christmas\" (both: audio: ***, video: ***, extras: ***). Staying true to the character's precociousness, the creators have made up great storylines that show Eloise's curious, creative personality and her ability to be inclusive and generous. In the first show, Eloise makes friends with an 8-year-old violin prodigy from Tokyo who moves into New York's famous Plaza Hotel. Eloise teaches Yuko and her parents that there is more to life than practicing the violin. In the Christmas show, Eloise and her Plaza pals go to great lengths in the face of many roadblocks to put on a yuletide show for some of New York's downtrodden. New characters are introduced, but they stay true to the fun and antics. Lynn Redgrave voices Nanny, Eloise's guardian when her mother's not around, and Tim Curry voices Plaza manager Mr. Salamone; both do fabulous jobs in those roles. The extras are quite fun, too. The menu is an elevator, and viewers push the floor buttons to access special features, including cartoon shorts and Plaza scenes. Other extras include a quick look at some of the shows' characters as narrated by Eloise, a different game on each of the DVDs and a look at sketches and the final animated product that run simultaneously on the screen it's pretty neat. Eloise creator Kay Thompson is rumored to have based her books on her own life, as well as that of her goddaughter, Liza Minelli and she would probably get a kick out of this version of her famous creation. (Both: Enhanced widescreen and fullscreen, 2006, not rated) - Toni Guagenti The bonus, in and of itself, is owning \"It's The Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown\" (audio: ****, video, ****, extras: *) on DVD. So don't get excited, because that story and a bonus feature, \"You're Not Elected, Charlie Brown,\" are all you get on this \"Peanuts Classic\" release. Watching Sally, Charlie Brown's sister, freak out on Linus after they miss Halloween camped out in the pumpkin patch waiting for the Great Pumpkin is hysterical. \"You blockhead!\" she screams at him, realizing she's missed out on the candy-collecting. Plus, she can't get any goodies from her brother, because all he got was rocks. This classic can be enjoyed over and over again. In the second feature, Charlie Brown doesn't get to run for class office because Lucy's unscientific polling discovers no one would vote for him. Poor Charlie Brown. But Linus gets a shot and almost blows it after promising the kids a visit from the Great Pumpkin as part of his platform. The colors pop on this DVD, including the vivid hues of Linus' red tee, Lucy's blue dress and Charlie Brown's yellow shirt. The music's in Dolby Digital, and Vince Guaraldi's score is perfect. (Fullscreen, 1966, not rated) Toni Guagenti Peter Bogdanovich's \"They All Laughed: 25th Anniversary Edition\" (audio: ***, video: ***, extras:***) features Audrey Hepburn in her final starring role in a theatrical film. Although both Quentin Tarantino and Wes Anderson consider it one of their favorite films of all time, it was a huge bomb when it was originally released and nearly destroyed Bogdanovich. Actress Dorothy Stratten was murdered after the film's shooting was completed and studios distanced themselves from the film, refusing to release it because of the bad publicity surrounding the tragedy. Bogdanovich put in $5 million of his own money and distributed the film himself. The shooting was also plagued by tension on the set between Hepburn and actor Ben Gazzara, who had recently split up with Hepburn to marry another woman. Twenty-five years have put enough distance between the behind-the-scenes drama to make it possible to appreciate this tremendously fun, if slight, screwball comedy about a team of detectives who get involved with two women they are investigating for suspected adultery. The DVD includes a video conversation between Bogdanovich and Anderson and a thoroughly enjoyable commentary by Bogdanovich. (Enhanced wide-screen, 1981, rated PG) - Josh Boone \"Numb3rs: The Complete Second Season\" (audio: ***, video: ***, extras: ***1/2) builds on the half-season that got the series off to a solid start. Forget struggles to de-randomize shooting sprees; mathematician Charlie Eppes (David Krumholtz) helps his brother Don (Rob Morrow) and other FBI agents solve arsons, stalkings and robberies this season. The set offers seven episodes with commentaries that run the gamut from lighthearted efforts that offer little insight (\"Obsession\") to discussions that provide a lot of technical information (\"Scorched,\" which talks about how they set up and film the fiery effects) to one that tackles the sensitive issue of how the creators mixed the issue of gang murders with David Sinclair (Alimi Ballard) in \"The O.G.\" That episode was problematic because the creators didn't want to link Sinclair, the show's key black agent, to gangs. He discusses his initial reaction to the episode and how his attitude changed after seeing the script and talking with the director. The other extras bloopers and two behind-the-scenes featurettes with Nicolas Falacci and Krumholtz aren't really worth viewing. (Enhanced widescreen, 2005-06, not rated but adult content for violence) L.A. Luebbert In \"Combat Diary: The Marines of Lima Company\" (audio: ***, video: ***, extras: ***) we get to see what it was like for one of the hardest-hit combat units in the war. Along with all their other gear, the Reserve unit from Columbus, Ohio, was equipped with home video cameras. This war documentary produced by A&E IndieFilms is raw. It is a firsthand account of what the real deal is in Iraq. The heat, the connection between the troops. The casualties. It is revealing to see the initial enthusiasm of the company and how that feeling changes as the reality of war sets in. For those who want to romanticize the war, it's not going to happen here. Wherever your political beliefs about the war in Iraq lie, watching this riveting DVD will show you another view from the vantage point of the warriors. Extras include bonus footage that was left out of the original offering. There is a very touching video greeting from a Marine who taped a birthday message to his daughter back home just a month before he was killed. There is also a slide show with commentary by three of the men who took the pictures and a biography/filmography of the director. (Enhanced widescreen, 2006, not rated but contains some very graphic material) Cliff Redding As \"That 70s Show: Season Five\" (audio: ***1/2, video: ***1/2, extras: **) gets rolling, Eric (Topher Grace), Donna (Laura Prepon), Kelso (Ashton Kutcher) and the gang are gearing up for their senior year of high school. For the series, much like many a star high-school athlete, it would be all downhill after that. But season five presents the cast and writing still in prime form and, arguably, at its peak of popularity. Guest appearances by Jessica Simpson and Luke Wilson, among others, help add spice to the goings-on. The set's weak lineup of extras continues an ongoing trend with this series. While the first couple of seasons feature some audio commentaries and other standard goodies, this set (and the previous two) includes a pair of rather weak featurettes sit-downs with Danny Masterson and Wilmer Valderrama as well as the original promos for each episode and \"Season 5 in 5 Minutes,\" which offers a quick rundown of the season's main story arcs. These sets could be much more impressive if only Fox would put a little bit of pride into their work. (Fullscreen, 2002, not rated) Robert Hatfield In \"Andy Milonakis: The Complete Second Season,\" (audio: ***, video: ***, extras: ****) the rapping Jewish kid from the Lower East Side only gets better. Part hidden-camera reality show, part sketch comedy and part, well, crazy, the MTV2 show thrives with a unique brand of comedy that's low-budget and childish think biting into a worm and finding an apple, or a tin-can phone that leaks creamed corn. This season Andy, who, because of a birth defect looks like a teenager but is in fact 30 years old, continues to terrorize old folks in the L.E.S and lampoon his dim-witted sidekick Ralphie. Fifteen extra skits are included each of them more silly and strange than the next as well as two music videos in which Andy does his cartoonish but surprisingly decent raps. Warning: This is only for the truly goofy it's like Tom Green drunk on soda. (Fullscreen, 2006, not rated) - Malcolm Venable When a TV show's title is too rude for print, it goes without saying that its content may be more than a little risque. The magician duo at the helm of \"Penn & Teller: Bulls**t! The Complete Third Season\" (audio: ***, video, ***, extras, no stars) certainly haven't run out of opinions to express or dubious claims to debunk. They are hostile to conspiracy theories, government intrusion, organized religion, self-help mumbo-jumbo, the paranormal and silly toupees which is to say, viewers never know whether they'll be entertained, offended, or both. In the raucous, profanity-laced third season, the Showtime show takes on hair obsessions, circumcision (you can imagine the visual aids employed), gun control, family values, life coaching, religious relics (such as the Virgin Mary grilled-cheese sandwich), the Endangered Species Act and America's relentless quest for the best. The show is sometimes cruel and bombastic, but so gleefully irreverent that it's hard to stay angry for long. How upset can you get with a show that dares to show exactly yes, exactly what a bikini wax entails? Although there's plenty to enjoy in the third season, there's nothing extra to cheer about on this three-disc set. The only goodies are a lame collection of publicity photos and a list of the duo's movie and TV credits no outtakes, extra footage or commentaries. Packaging three discs with no decent extras? As Penn Jillette would say, that's a load of well, you get the drift. (Fullscreen, 2005, not rated) Caroline Luzzatto Three minor Michael Caine films are out as part of 20th Century Fox's Cinema Classics Collection. The biggest disappointment is \"The Magus\" (audio: ***, video: ***, extras: **), based on John Fowles' bestselling novel. Fowles wrote the screenplay of this convoluted, pretentious movie, starring Caine as Nicholas, an English teacher assigned to a school on a little Greek island. When Nicholas meets an enigmatic character named Maurice (Anthony Quinn) who lives with a beautiful young woman (Candice Bergen), the weirdness begins. Meanwhile, Nicholas is involved in a troubled relationship with a stewardess (Anna Karina), who appears from time to time in flashbacks. What is actually going on in the story is anyone's guess. There are plays within plays, masquerades, hints of magic and insanity, replete with awkward, purple prose. The one extra on this disc is a somewhat interesting documentary on Fowles, containing interviews with his biographer, fans, a literature professor and his editor at Little, Brown. In discussing \"The Magus,\" Fowles' first novel, which took him 10 years to write, the prof sees the themes as true love and the meaning of life. His editor calls him the \"best prose stylist of the 20th century.\" (Enhanced wide screen, 1968, rated PG) In \"Deadfall\" (audio: ***, video: ***, extras: **1/2), Caine is a jewel thief who is sucked into an elaborate heist scheme with an unlikely married couple. There is enough going on in this (comparatively) well-written film to keep it interesting. One special feature offers the isolated score, composed by John Barry. There is also a documentary on Barry and his illustrious career. The English composer was responsible for the James Bond soundtracks, \"Out of Africa,\" \"Body Heat,\" \"The Lion in Winter,\" and hundreds more. Barry has a bit part in \"Deadfall\" as the conductor of a beautiful guitar symphony he composed. (Enhanced wide screen, 1968, rated R for nudity and sexual situations) \"Peeper\" (audio: **, video: ***, extras: **) stars Caine as Leslie Tucker, an L.A. private eye in 1947, hired by an eccentric wealthy man to find his adult daughter, who had been adopted as a child, so he can give her her rightful inheritance. Tucker finds the right family but isn't sure which of the daughters (played by Natalie Wood and Kitty Winn) is the lucky one. This spoof of a film noir is mildly entertaining, but definitely a grade B-minus. Extras include an interview with the director, Peter Hyams, who confesses to being a \"Raymond Chandler freak.\" Hyams refers to the box office failure of the film as one of the \"scars\" in his life. In another, much more enjoyable, extra, film noir is examined in general. Clips from classic '40s movies are shown, as are more modern ones from the \"rebirth\" of the genre, with examples like \"Chinatown\" and \"Taxi Driver.\" (Enhanced widescreen, 1975, rated PG) Peggy Earle",

                "text": "VirginianPilot-tDVD jacket for \"Over the Hedge\" from DreamWorks Animation and Paramount Home Entertainment. \"Over the Hedge\" It's about a band of critters who wake up from hibernation in the spring to discover a hedge separating them from the 'burbs. At first, they're scared of the tall, foreboding bush, which they call \"Steve\" for lack of a better name, until R.J. the raccoon (Bruce Willis) shows them the utopia in suburbia. The movie, based on the popular cartoon of the same name, is smartly written and has wonderful computer animation a glimpse of which you get in the extra features. Not only is the story fun, but the DVD is packed with great extras including a couple not-so-easy games, such as the Skee-Ball-like Hammy Nut Toss. Commentary by directors Tim Johnson, Karey Kirkpatrick and producer Bonnie Arnold shows their pride in the whole package, from which effects were the hardest to animate to some of Thomas Haden Church's ad-libs as exterminator Dwayne. Other extras worth watching include a new animated short, \"Hammy's Boomerang Adventure,\" \"Dwayne's Verm-Tech Infomercial\" and a look at the actors who do the voices, including Portsmouth's own Wanda Sykes as Stella the skunk. (Enhanced widescreen, 2006, rated PG for some rude humor and mild comic action) Toni Guagenti Inline image:VirginianPilot-tHD-DVD/DVD comb disc jacket for \"The Break-Up\" from Universal Studios Home Entertainment. In brief, \"The Break-Up\" (audio, ***, video: ***1/2, extras: ****) is \"Swingers\" revisited. So if you're looking for light, romantic comedy, this isn't it. But if you want a blend of comedy and drama and don't mind revisiting some dialogues . you may have had in the past, then spend time with Vince Vaughn, Jennifer Aniston and the splendid cast including Jon Favreau, Jason Bateman, Joey Lauren Adams and Vincent D'Onofrio that plays their family and friends. Viewers will find conflict as soon as the DVD and HD-DVD opens. You'll get to pick a \"his side\" or \"her side\" to watch the film. It's the same movie no matter what you pick, but can't you picture couples fighting for the remote? Vaughn co-wrote and produced the film and provides an in-depth commentary. Aniston is also featured, although she's strictly support. A second commentary with director Peyton Reed is also worthwhile. But what truly makes the DVD worth its price is an alternate ending, similar to the theater version, except that it also features the hilarious Tone Rangers and their leader, John Michael Higgins. The HD version of \"Break-Up\" brings a bigger pop in picture and sound. It also has the \"U Control\" feature that allows viewers to watch highlights from the extras as the film runs. Make sure you're up-to-date with the latest firmware software (2.0 version) for your Toshiba HD-DVD player, to use the U Control feature. (HD widescreen & enhanced widescreen, 2006, rated PG-13 for sexual content, some nudity and language) Kay Reynolds Inline image:VirginianPilot-tDVD jacket for \"Feast:Unrated\" from The Weinstein Company. \"Feast\" (audio:***, video:***, extras:**1/2) is the third film born from the reality television series \"Project Greenlight,\" spearheaded by Ben Affleck, Matt Damon and Chris Moore. While the show is terrific, the resulting films have been lackluster straight-to-video fare. With the threat of cancellation looming, the third season was devoted to making a commercially viable horror film, and the filmmakers may have succeeded. This unrated edition of \"Feast,\" a loud and predictable monster movie, should sell and rent well on DVD. Extras include a commentary with director John Gulager, producers Mike Leahy and Joel Soisson, writers Marcus Dunstan and Patrick Melton, and creature and makeup effects designer Garry Tunnicliffe. Deleted scenes and two brief promotional featurettes are also on display. The show that spawned \"Feast\" may not fare quite so well. Although the previous two seasons were released on DVD simultaneously with their featured movie, the third season of \"Greenlight\" is has yet to see the light of day, and at present, the show has not been picked up for a fourth season. (Enhanced widescreen, 2006, unrated) Josh Boone Inline image:VirginianPilot-t Is it blasphemy to remake a classic film? Maybe if we were talking about \"Casablanca.\" Making a hands-off case for \"The Omen\" (audio, ***, video, ***1/2, extras, ****) isn't as easy. The original, directed by Richard Donner and starring Gregory Peck and Lee Remick as the duped parents, was released in 1976. Honestly, it was difficult to believe that Peck so well known for his role as Atticus Finch in \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" could be thwarted by the devil's child. Would Peck/Finch lie to his wife about replacing their baby? Take us up to 2006 with a new cast and the plot is easier to swallow. So are the new, state of the art visual effects. Director John Moore, who also filmed the remake of \"Flight of the Phoenix,\" was visited by the \"Omen\" curse while rushing the film for release on June 6, 2006 all the better to take advantage of \"Number of the Beast\" tie in. Viewers can get the details in Moore's commentary and in a featurette, \"Omenisms.\" Additional supernatural lore is explored in \"Revelation 666,\" but it's a choppy piece no pun intended. You'll find better on The Discovery and Sci-Fi channels. An additional feature on the score, deleted and extended scenes, with commentary, round out the standard extras for decent Halloween party viewing. The film is a near scene-for-scene remake. It's the cast, including Liev Schreiber, Julia Stiles, Pete Postlethwaite, David Thewlis and a particularly scary little boy, Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick, who'll hold your interest. Mia Farrow shows up, too, as an especially protective nanny who would be perfect in a \"Halloween\"-type remake of \"Mary Poppins.\" (Enhanced widescreen, 2006, rated for disturbing violent content, graphic images and some language) Kay Reynolds Inline image:VirginianPilot-t During the turbulent 1960s, an unwritten rule dominated college basketball in Texas. You never play more than one black basketball player at home. Two if you're on the road and three only if you're losing. Coach Don Haskins (Josh Lucas) at tiny Texas Western University in El Paso wanted to win and that meant bucking the system. After searching far and wide, Haskins selected seven African-American players, mostly from north of the Mason-Dixon Line. By season's end, Texas Western made it to a national championship and defeated an all-white Kentucky team under legendary coach Adolph Rupp. NBA coach and Kentucky guard Pat Riley calls the victory the \"emancipation proclamation of 1966\" during an interview at the closing credits. The inspirational \"Glory Road\" (audio: ****, video: ****, extras: **) shines in high-def Blu-ray, with a spectacular picture and uncompressed digital sound, but Disney shortchanged the extras. Two documentaries featured on the low-tech DVD have vanished, one that highlighted Haskins' 30-year-plus career, the other that included interviews with his players and colleagues. Two commentaries are intact, including one with first-time director James Gartner, handpicked by producer Jerry Bruckheimer. Gartner is quite open about his shortcomings, wishing he had tightened a few scenes, but details the racial tension on-screen in scenes with Bobby Joe Hill (Derek Luke). \"Luke's character is full of quiet anger, as benched talent,\" Gartner says, since most black players of his era never saw action in the South. (HD widescreen, 2006, PG for racial issues including violence and epithets, and momentary language) Samsung Blu-ray player update: The first firmware software download is available at () to correct issues that have plagued the player since its launch in June minus the fix for the slightly soft picture. That will be addressed in the next version. Here's the list of fixes with firmware 1.0v (DTS sound causing image jitter, improved loading time, correct analog outputs if reversed, and 4:3 pillarboxing for BD content) - Bill Kelley III Paul Weitz, the writer and director of \"In Good Company,\" satirizes both \"American Idol\" and George Bush's presidency in \"American Dreamz\" (audio:***1/2, video:***1/2, extras:***), a film that succeeds as often as it fails. Hugh Grant plays the Simon Cowell-esque host, Mandy Moore plays the camera-loving idol, and Dennis Quaid plays the bumbling Bush clone who serves as guest judge on the \"American Idol\" stand-in \"American Dreamz\" to raise his falling numbers with voters. Weitz insists he wrote the script before ever watching \"American Idol,\" something very hard to believe. Extras include a commentary with Weitz and actor Sam Golzari (who has the best role in the film as a sleeper cell terrorist who would rather dance and sing than kill anyone), deleted scenes, and two brief featurettes. (Enhanced wide-screen, 2006, rated PG-13 for brief strong language and some sexual references) Josh Boone Watch your back or get got. That was the way of life for some in Bed-Stuy in the '80s. (That's the Brooklyn neighborhood of Bedford-Stuyvesant, for those not up on New York lingo.) Comedian Chris Rock weaves tales from his childhood in New York in his sitcom \"Everybody Hates Chris: The First Season\" (audio: ***, video: ***, extras: ****). Tichina Arnold, Terry Crews, Imani Hakim and Tequan Richmond star. Tyler James Williams stars as Chris. Executive producer and co-creator Ali LeRoi shares the science of casting in the DVD extras. Williams, a fairly unknown actor before the show, was a perfect fit because the audience could get to know him as Chris. Better than that, Williams was a real 13-year-old boy, awkwardness and all. Hakim, a Cleveland native, makes the perfect little sister because she looks like an ordinary neighborhood kid. \"I was happy because I came out of the ghetto and got this part,\" Hakim says in the extras. And Richmond just has that cooler younger brother look, Rock and LeRoi said. The comedy is loosely based on Rock's life, but it's no autobiography. Rock really has six brothers and one sister. On the show, he has two siblings. \"There's a portion of the show that reflects Chris' life, and it's really in the tone,\" LeRoi said. The 22-episode DVD release also includes cast and crew commentaries on select episodes, featurettes, bloopers, deleted scenes, set photos and audition reels. It's comedy and Chris Rock is involved, so of course, it's lots of fun. (Enhanced widescreen, 2005-06. not rated) DeAnne M. Bradley Although the Mormon Church banned polygamy in 1890, at least 40,000 people are thought to practice it and more may be watching it on cable. HBO continues its tradition of delivering the finest dramatic shows on television with \"Big Love: The Complete First Season\" (audio: ***1/2, video: ***1/2, extras: **1/2), an even-handed look at modern-day polygamy in Salt Lake City. Bill Paxton stars as the head of the family with three beautiful wives (Jeanne Tripplehorn, Chloe Sevigny, Ginnifer Goodwin), seven kids, and a thriving business. He has all the trouble three families would bring three mortgages, warring personalities, sexual dysfunction, and more. Harry Dean Stanton steals the show as the creepy backwoods patriarch of a polygamist commune. As is always the case with HBO, this five-disc set containing 12 episodes will run you a very steep $100. Extras are also thin for a set this highly priced. Three commentaries and a brief look at the creation of the opening title sequence are all viewers have to chew on. But if you want the best, you have to pay the price. (Enhanced wide-screen, 2006, unrated) - Josh Boone Eloise is an imp with a heart and her personality shines through on IDT Entertainment's new line of animated stories, including the new releases \"Me, Eloise\" and \"Eloise: Little Miss Christmas\" (both: audio: ***, video: ***, extras: ***). Staying true to the character's precociousness, the creators have made up great storylines that show Eloise's curious, creative personality and her ability to be inclusive and generous. In the first show, Eloise makes friends with an 8-year-old violin prodigy from Tokyo who moves into New York's famous Plaza Hotel. Eloise teaches Yuko and her parents that there is more to life than practicing the violin. In the Christmas show, Eloise and her Plaza pals go to great lengths in the face of many roadblocks to put on a yuletide show for some of New York's downtrodden. New characters are introduced, but they stay true to the fun and antics. Lynn Redgrave voices Nanny, Eloise's guardian when her mother's not around, and Tim Curry voices Plaza manager Mr. Salamone; both do fabulous jobs in those roles. The extras are quite fun, too. The menu is an elevator, and viewers push the floor buttons to access special features, including cartoon shorts and Plaza scenes. Other extras include a quick look at some of the shows' characters as narrated by Eloise, a different game on each of the DVDs and a look at sketches and the final animated product that run simultaneously on the screen it's pretty neat. Eloise creator Kay Thompson is rumored to have based her books on her own life, as well as that of her goddaughter, Liza Minelli and she would probably get a kick out of this version of her famous creation. (Both: Enhanced widescreen and fullscreen, 2006, not rated) - Toni Guagenti The bonus, in and of itself, is owning \"It's The Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown\" (audio: ****, video, ****, extras: *) on DVD. So don't get excited, because that story and a bonus feature, \"You're Not Elected, Charlie Brown,\" are all you get on this \"Peanuts Classic\" release. Watching Sally, Charlie Brown's sister, freak out on Linus after they miss Halloween camped out in the pumpkin patch waiting for the Great Pumpkin is hysterical. \"You blockhead!\" she screams at him, realizing she's missed out on the candy-collecting. Plus, she can't get any goodies from her brother, because all he got was rocks. This classic can be enjoyed over and over again. In the second feature, Charlie Brown doesn't get to run for class office because Lucy's unscientific polling discovers no one would vote for him. Poor Charlie Brown. But Linus gets a shot and almost blows it after promising the kids a visit from the Great Pumpkin as part of his platform. The colors pop on this DVD, including the vivid hues of Linus' red tee, Lucy's blue dress and Charlie Brown's yellow shirt. The music's in Dolby Digital, and Vince Guaraldi's score is perfect. (Fullscreen, 1966, not rated) Toni Guagenti Peter Bogdanovich's \"They All Laughed: 25th Anniversary Edition\" (audio: ***, video: ***, extras:***) features Audrey Hepburn in her final starring role in a theatrical film. Although both Quentin Tarantino and Wes Anderson consider it one of their favorite films of all time, it was a huge bomb when it was originally released and nearly destroyed Bogdanovich. Actress Dorothy Stratten was murdered after the film's shooting was completed and studios distanced themselves from the film, refusing to release it because of the bad publicity surrounding the tragedy. Bogdanovich put in $5 million of his own money and distributed the film himself. The shooting was also plagued by tension on the set between Hepburn and actor Ben Gazzara, who had recently split up with Hepburn to marry another woman. Twenty-five years have put enough distance between the behind-the-scenes drama to make it possible to appreciate this tremendously fun, if slight, screwball comedy about a team of detectives who get involved with two women they are investigating for suspected adultery. The DVD includes a video conversation between Bogdanovich and Anderson and a thoroughly enjoyable commentary by Bogdanovich. (Enhanced wide-screen, 1981, rated PG) - Josh Boone \"Numb3rs: The Complete Second Season\" (audio: ***, video: ***, extras: ***1/2) builds on the half-season that got the series off to a solid start. Forget struggles to de-randomize shooting sprees; mathematician Charlie Eppes (David Krumholtz) helps his brother Don (Rob Morrow) and other FBI agents solve arsons, stalkings and robberies this season. The set offers seven episodes with commentaries that run the gamut from lighthearted efforts that offer little insight (\"Obsession\") to discussions that provide a lot of technical information (\"Scorched,\" which talks about how they set up and film the fiery effects) to one that tackles the sensitive issue of how the creators mixed the issue of gang murders with David Sinclair (Alimi Ballard) in \"The O.G.\" That episode was problematic because the creators didn't want to link Sinclair, the show's key black agent, to gangs. He discusses his initial reaction to the episode and how his attitude changed after seeing the script and talking with the director. The other extras bloopers and two behind-the-scenes featurettes with Nicolas Falacci and Krumholtz aren't really worth viewing. (Enhanced widescreen, 2005-06, not rated but adult content for violence) L.A. Luebbert In \"Combat Diary: The Marines of Lima Company\" (audio: ***, video: ***, extras: ***) we get to see what it was like for one of the hardest-hit combat units in the war. Along with all their other gear, the Reserve unit from Columbus, Ohio, was equipped with home video cameras. This war documentary produced by A&E IndieFilms is raw. It is a firsthand account of what the real deal is in Iraq. The heat, the connection between the troops. The casualties. It is revealing to see the initial enthusiasm of the company and how that feeling changes as the reality of war sets in. For those who want to romanticize the war, it's not going to happen here. Wherever your political beliefs about the war in Iraq lie, watching this riveting DVD will show you another view from the vantage point of the warriors. Extras include bonus footage that was left out of the original offering. There is a very touching video greeting from a Marine who taped a birthday message to his daughter back home just a month before he was killed. There is also a slide show with commentary by three of the men who took the pictures and a biography/filmography of the director. (Enhanced widescreen, 2006, not rated but contains some very graphic material) Cliff Redding As \"That 70s Show: Season Five\" (audio: ***1/2, video: ***1/2, extras: **) gets rolling, Eric (Topher Grace), Donna (Laura Prepon), Kelso (Ashton Kutcher) and the gang are gearing up for their senior year of high school. For the series, much like many a star high-school athlete, it would be all downhill after that. But season five presents the cast and writing still in prime form and, arguably, at its peak of popularity. Guest appearances by Jessica Simpson and Luke Wilson, among others, help add spice to the goings-on. The set's weak lineup of extras continues an ongoing trend with this series. While the first couple of seasons feature some audio commentaries and other standard goodies, this set (and the previous two) includes a pair of rather weak featurettes sit-downs with Danny Masterson and Wilmer Valderrama as well as the original promos for each episode and \"Season 5 in 5 Minutes,\" which offers a quick rundown of the season's main story arcs. These sets could be much more impressive if only Fox would put a little bit of pride into their work. (Fullscreen, 2002, not rated) Robert Hatfield In \"Andy Milonakis: The Complete Second Season,\" (audio: ***, video: ***, extras: ****) the rapping Jewish kid from the Lower East Side only gets better. Part hidden-camera reality show, part sketch comedy and part, well, crazy, the MTV2 show thrives with a unique brand of comedy that's low-budget and childish think biting into a worm and finding an apple, or a tin-can phone that leaks creamed corn. This season Andy, who, because of a birth defect looks like a teenager but is in fact 30 years old, continues to terrorize old folks in the L.E.S and lampoon his dim-witted sidekick Ralphie. Fifteen extra skits are included each of them more silly and strange than the next as well as two music videos in which Andy does his cartoonish but surprisingly decent raps. Warning: This is only for the truly goofy it's like Tom Green drunk on soda. (Fullscreen, 2006, not rated) - Malcolm Venable When a TV show's title is too rude for print, it goes without saying that its content may be more than a little risque. The magician duo at the helm of \"Penn & Teller: Bulls**t! The Complete Third Season\" (audio: ***, video, ***, extras, no stars) certainly haven't run out of opinions to express or dubious claims to debunk. They are hostile to conspiracy theories, government intrusion, organized religion, self-help mumbo-jumbo, the paranormal and silly toupees which is to say, viewers never know whether they'll be entertained, offended, or both. In the raucous, profanity-laced third season, the Showtime show takes on hair obsessions, circumcision (you can imagine the visual aids employed), gun control, family values, life coaching, religious relics (such as the Virgin Mary grilled-cheese sandwich), the Endangered Species Act and America's relentless quest for the best. The show is sometimes cruel and bombastic, but so gleefully irreverent that it's hard to stay angry for long. How upset can you get with a show that dares to show exactly yes, exactly what a bikini wax entails? Although there's plenty to enjoy in the third season, there's nothing extra to cheer about on this three-disc set. The only goodies are a lame collection of publicity photos and a list of the duo's movie and TV credits no outtakes, extra footage or commentaries. Packaging three discs with no decent extras? As Penn Jillette would say, that's a load of well, you get the drift. (Fullscreen, 2005, not rated) Caroline Luzzatto Three minor Michael Caine films are out as part of 20th Century Fox's Cinema Classics Collection. The biggest disappointment is \"The Magus\" (audio: ***, video: ***, extras: **), based on John Fowles' bestselling novel. Fowles wrote the screenplay of this convoluted, pretentious movie, starring Caine as Nicholas, an English teacher assigned to a school on a little Greek island. When Nicholas meets an enigmatic character named Maurice (Anthony Quinn) who lives with a beautiful young woman (Candice Bergen), the weirdness begins. Meanwhile, Nicholas is involved in a troubled relationship with a stewardess (Anna Karina), who appears from time to time in flashbacks. What is actually going on in the story is anyone's guess. There are plays within plays, masquerades, hints of magic and insanity, replete with awkward, purple prose. The one extra on this disc is a somewhat interesting documentary on Fowles, containing interviews with his biographer, fans, a literature professor and his editor at Little, Brown. In discussing \"The Magus,\" Fowles' first novel, which took him 10 years to write, the prof sees the themes as true love and the meaning of life. His editor calls him the \"best prose stylist of the 20th century.\" (Enhanced wide screen, 1968, rated PG) In \"Deadfall\" (audio: ***, video: ***, extras: **1/2), Caine is a jewel thief who is sucked into an elaborate heist scheme with an unlikely married couple. There is enough going on in this (comparatively) well-written film to keep it interesting. One special feature offers the isolated score, composed by John Barry. There is also a documentary on Barry and his illustrious career. The English composer was responsible for the James Bond soundtracks, \"Out of Africa,\" \"Body Heat,\" \"The Lion in Winter,\" and hundreds more. Barry has a bit part in \"Deadfall\" as the conductor of a beautiful guitar symphony he composed. (Enhanced wide screen, 1968, rated R for nudity and sexual situations) \"Peeper\" (audio: **, video: ***, extras: **) stars Caine as Leslie Tucker, an L.A. private eye in 1947, hired by an eccentric wealthy man to find his adult daughter, who had been adopted as a child, so he can give her her rightful inheritance. Tucker finds the right family but isn't sure which of the daughters (played by Natalie Wood and Kitty Winn) is the lucky one. This spoof of a film noir is mildly entertaining, but definitely a grade B-minus. Extras include an interview with the director, Peter Hyams, who confesses to being a \"Raymond Chandler freak.\" Hyams refers to the box office failure of the film as one of the \"scars\" in his life. In another, much more enjoyable, extra, film noir is examined in general. Clips from classic '40s movies are shown, as are more modern ones from the \"rebirth\" of the genre, with examples like \"Chinatown\" and \"Taxi Driver.\" (Enhanced widescreen, 1975, rated PG) Peggy Earle",

                "text": "No. 2 Salem at Green Run Records: Salem 6-0 overall and Beach District, Green Run 1-6 The lowdown: Salem is alone atop the Beach District. Green Run has lost three consecutive games. The Sun Devils lead the Beach District in total offense, points scored and total defense, and RB Kevin Whaley has 838 yards and 15 TDs. He is 20 yards in front of Kempsville's Kevin Simmons for the Beach District rushing lead and with 3,313 career yards is closing in on South Hampton Roads' all-time top 10. Green Run hasn't scored more than two touchdowns in a game since the season opener and is coming off a shutout loss to Ocean Lakes. Jami says: Tallwood awaits Nov. 3. Salem, 38-7. Larry says: Sun Devils keep rolling. Salem, 37-0. Norview vs. Granby Site: Powhatan Field Records: Norview 4-3 overall, 2-2 Eastern District; Granby 0-6, 0-3 The lowdown: Norview snapped a three-game losing streak last week by defeating Wilson 35-0. RB Marquez Fields leads South Hampton Roads in rushing with 969 yards and has scored 10 TDs. Granby has scored seven total points in back-to-back losses to Oscar Smith and Norcom. The Comets are off to the program's worst start in at least a decade and are headed for their lowest victory total since finishing 3-7 in 2002. Jami says: Norview, 25-12. Larry says: Norview, 26-20. Cox at No. 7 Tallwood Records: Cox 1-5 overall and Beach District, Tallwood 5-1 The lowdown: Tallwood has won three in a row after a loss to Bayside to stay in the playoff hunt. The Lions are realistically the only team with any shot of catching unbeaten Salem in the Beach District race. Tallwood plays Salem on Nov. 3. QB Brian Jackson has thrown for 651 yards and eight TDs and last week played with a bad cut on his throwing hand. He's expected to play tonight. Cox started 0-4, but the Falcons defeated Green Run and last week played Bayside tough before losing 17-9. Cox sophomore Drew Jarrett has four field goals. Jami says: Lions haven't started 6-1 since 1998 - when they won an Eastern Region title. Tallwood, 20-6. Larry says: Lions keep playoff hopes alive. Tallwood, 37-26. No. 10 Kellam at Kempsville Records: Kellam 4-2 overall and Beach District, Kempsville 3-4 The lowdown: Kellam crept back into the South Hampton Roads top 10 after defeating Princess Anne, and the Knights have won three of their past four games. Kellam is averaging 199.3 rushing yards per game, and last season snapped a three-game losing streak against Kempsville. This year, Kempsville has been slowed by injuries. RB Kevin Simmons has steadily climbed the rushing leaders list since missing the season opener and has 818 yards and eight TDs. Jami says: Simmons sizzles. Kempsville, 28-27. Larry says: Kempsville has won six of the past eight meetings, but Knights prevail this time. Kellam, 24-21. Great Bridge at Nansemond River Records: Great Bridge 2-4 overall, 1-4 Southeastern District; Nansemond River 2-5, 1-4 The lowdown: Great Bridge is coming off a heart-breaking loss to Western Branch in which the Wildcats reached the Bruins' 2-yard line in the closing seconds. That was Great Bridge's second consecutive loss by a touchdown. Junior QB Casey Turner surpassed 4,000 career yards for his career and is seventh on South Hampton Roads' all-time list. Nansemond River has lost four straight games and has lost back-to-back games against the Wildcats - three counting a Warriors forfeit in 2003. Jami says: Casey and the 'Cats rebound. Great Bridge, 30-13. Larry says: It has been a what-if season for the Wildcats. Great Bridge, 34-14. Lakeland at Indian River Records: Lakeland 0-6 overall, 0-5 Southeastern District; Indian River 3-3, 2-2 The lowdown: The Cavaliers' losing streak hit 16 with last week's loss to Hickory. Lakeland hasn't defeated Indian River since 2002. The Braves are banged up, and coach Cadillac Harris says QB Dravon Poittilo's status is a game-time decision. Poittilo, who has thrown for 949 yards, missed last week's loss to Lake Taylor because of a concussion. WR/DB Dominic Blanchard replaced him in Indian River's pass-first offense, completing 9 of 30 passes for 112 yards; he was sacked nine times. Jami says: With or without Poittilo, Braves roll. Indian River, 31-7. Larry says: Braves playing for respect. Indian River, 34-0. No. 9 Landstown at First Colonial Records: Landstown 5-2 overall and Beach District; First Colonial 3-3 The lowdown: Landstown is coming off the worst loss in school history - a 42-2 whipping at the hands of Salem. The Eagles were plagued by turnovers in that one and unraveled in the second half. Landstown hasn't lost to First Colonial since the Eagles' inaugural season in 2001. The Patriots had a bye last week after losing 26-13 against Salem on Oct. 6. First Colonial ranks ninth in South Hampton Roads in scoring at 23.5 points per game, and RB Tony Gregory has rushed for 479 yards and six TDs. Jami says: Can the Eagles recover? Landstown, 21-19. Larry says: Eagles continue win streak over First Colonial. Landstown, 27-20.

                "text": "VirginianPilot-tDVD jacket for \"Over the Hedge\" from DreamWorks Animation and Paramount Home Entertainment. \"Over the Hedge\" It's about a band of critters who wake up from hibernation in the spring to discover a hedge separating them from the 'burbs. At first, they're scared of the tall, foreboding bush, which they call \"Steve\" for lack of a better name, until R.J. the raccoon (Bruce Willis) shows them the utopia in suburbia. The movie, based on the popular cartoon of the same name, is smartly written and has wonderful computer animation a glimpse of which you get in the extra features. Not only is the story fun, but the DVD is packed with great extras including a couple not-so-easy games, such as the Skee-Ball-like Hammy Nut Toss. Commentary by directors Tim Johnson, Karey Kirkpatrick and producer Bonnie Arnold shows their pride in the whole package, from which effects were the hardest to animate to some of Thomas Haden Church's ad-libs as exterminator Dwayne. Other extras worth watching include a new animated short, \"Hammy's Boomerang Adventure,\" \"Dwayne's Verm-Tech Infomercial\" and a look at the actors who do the voices, including Portsmouth's own Wanda Sykes as Stella the skunk. (Enhanced widescreen, 2006, rated PG for some rude humor and mild comic action) Toni Guagenti Inline image:VirginianPilot-tHD-DVD/DVD comb disc jacket for \"The Break-Up\" from Universal Studios Home Entertainment. In brief, \"The Break-Up\" (audio, ***, video: ***1/2, extras: ****) is \"Swingers\" revisited. So if you're looking for light, romantic comedy, this isn't it. But if you want a blend of comedy and drama and don't mind revisiting some dialogues . you may have had in the past, then spend time with Vince Vaughn, Jennifer Aniston and the splendid cast including Jon Favreau, Jason Bateman, Joey Lauren Adams and Vincent D'Onofrio that plays their family and friends. Viewers will find conflict as soon as the DVD and HD-DVD opens. You'll get to pick a \"his side\" or \"her side\" to watch the film. It's the same movie no matter what you pick, but can't you picture couples fighting for the remote? Vaughn co-wrote and produced the film and provides an in-depth commentary. Aniston is also featured, although she's strictly support. A second commentary with director Peyton Reed is also worthwhile. But what truly makes the DVD worth its price is an alternate ending, similar to the theater version, except that it also features the hilarious Tone Rangers and their leader, John Michael Higgins. The HD version of \"Break-Up\" brings a bigger pop in picture and sound. It also has the \"U Control\" feature that allows viewers to watch highlights from the extras as the film runs. Make sure you're up-to-date with the latest firmware software (2.0 version) for your Toshiba HD-DVD player, to use the U Control feature. (HD widescreen & enhanced widescreen, 2006, rated PG-13 for sexual content, some nudity and language) Kay Reynolds Inline image:VirginianPilot-tDVD jacket for \"Feast:Unrated\" from The Weinstein Company. \"Feast\" (audio:***, video:***, extras:**1/2) is the third film born from the reality television series \"Project Greenlight,\" spearheaded by Ben Affleck, Matt Damon and Chris Moore. While the show is terrific, the resulting films have been lackluster straight-to-video fare. With the threat of cancellation looming, the third season was devoted to making a commercially viable horror film, and the filmmakers may have succeeded. This unrated edition of \"Feast,\" a loud and predictable monster movie, should sell and rent well on DVD. Extras include a commentary with director John Gulager, producers Mike Leahy and Joel Soisson, writers Marcus Dunstan and Patrick Melton, and creature and makeup effects designer Garry Tunnicliffe. Deleted scenes and two brief promotional featurettes are also on display. The show that spawned \"Feast\" may not fare quite so well. Although the previous two seasons were released on DVD simultaneously with their featured movie, the third season of \"Greenlight\" is has yet to see the light of day, and at present, the show has not been picked up for a fourth season. (Enhanced widescreen, 2006, unrated) Josh Boone Inline image:VirginianPilot-t Is it blasphemy to remake a classic film? Maybe if we were talking about \"Casablanca.\" Making a hands-off case for \"The Omen\" (audio, ***, video, ***1/2, extras, ****) isn't as easy. The original, directed by Richard Donner and starring Gregory Peck and Lee Remick as the duped parents, was released in 1976. Honestly, it was difficult to believe that Peck so well known for his role as Atticus Finch in \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" could be thwarted by the devil's child. Would Peck/Finch lie to his wife about replacing their baby? Take us up to 2006 with a new cast and the plot is easier to swallow. So are the new, state of the art visual effects. Director John Moore, who also filmed the remake of \"Flight of the Phoenix,\" was visited by the \"Omen\" curse while rushing the film for release on June 6, 2006 all the better to take advantage of \"Number of the Beast\" tie in. Viewers can get the details in Moore's commentary and in a featurette, \"Omenisms.\" Additional supernatural lore is explored in \"Revelation 666,\" but it's a choppy piece no pun intended. You'll find better on The Discovery and Sci-Fi channels. An additional feature on the score, deleted and extended scenes, with commentary, round out the standard extras for decent Halloween party viewing. The film is a near scene-for-scene remake. It's the cast, including Liev Schreiber, Julia Stiles, Pete Postlethwaite, David Thewlis and a particularly scary little boy, Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick, who'll hold your interest. Mia Farrow shows up, too, as an especially protective nanny who would be perfect in a \"Halloween\"-type remake of \"Mary Poppins.\" (Enhanced widescreen, 2006, rated for disturbing violent content, graphic images and some language) Kay Reynolds Inline image:VirginianPilot-t During the turbulent 1960s, an unwritten rule dominated college basketball in Texas. You never play more than one black basketball player at home. Two if you're on the road and three only if you're losing. Coach Don Haskins (Josh Lucas) at tiny Texas Western University in El Paso wanted to win and that meant bucking the system. After searching far and wide, Haskins selected seven African-American players, mostly from north of the Mason-Dixon Line. By season's end, Texas Western made it to a national championship and defeated an all-white Kentucky team under legendary coach Adolph Rupp. NBA coach and Kentucky guard Pat Riley calls the victory the \"emancipation proclamation of 1966\" during an interview at the closing credits. The inspirational \"Glory Road\" (audio: ****, video: ****, extras: **) shines in high-def Blu-ray, with a spectacular picture and uncompressed digital sound, but Disney shortchanged the extras. Two documentaries featured on the low-tech DVD have vanished, one that highlighted Haskins' 30-year-plus career, the other that included interviews with his players and colleagues. Two commentaries are intact, including one with first-time director James Gartner, handpicked by producer Jerry Bruckheimer. Gartner is quite open about his shortcomings, wishing he had tightened a few scenes, but details the racial tension on-screen in scenes with Bobby Joe Hill (Derek Luke). \"Luke's character is full of quiet anger, as benched talent,\" Gartner says, since most black players of his era never saw action in the South. (HD widescreen, 2006, PG for racial issues including violence and epithets, and momentary language) Samsung Blu-ray player update: The first firmware software download is available at () to correct issues that have plagued the player since its launch in June minus the fix for the slightly soft picture. That will be addressed in the next version. Here's the list of fixes with firmware 1.0v (DTS sound causing image jitter, improved loading time, correct analog outputs if reversed, and 4:3 pillarboxing for BD content) - Bill Kelley III Paul Weitz, the writer and director of \"In Good Company,\" satirizes both \"American Idol\" and George Bush's presidency in \"American Dreamz\" (audio:***1/2, video:***1/2, extras:***), a film that succeeds as often as it fails. Hugh Grant plays the Simon Cowell-esque host, Mandy Moore plays the camera-loving idol, and Dennis Quaid plays the bumbling Bush clone who serves as guest judge on the \"American Idol\" stand-in \"American Dreamz\" to raise his falling numbers with voters. Weitz insists he wrote the script before ever watching \"American Idol,\" something very hard to believe. Extras include a commentary with Weitz and actor Sam Golzari (who has the best role in the film as a sleeper cell terrorist who would rather dance and sing than kill anyone), deleted scenes, and two brief featurettes. (Enhanced wide-screen, 2006, rated PG-13 for brief strong language and some sexual references) Josh Boone Watch your back or get got. That was the way of life for some in Bed-Stuy in the '80s. (That's the Brooklyn neighborhood of Bedford-Stuyvesant, for those not up on New York lingo.) Comedian Chris Rock weaves tales from his childhood in New York in his sitcom \"Everybody Hates Chris: The First Season\" (audio: ***, video: ***, extras: ****). Tichina Arnold, Terry Crews, Imani Hakim and Tequan Richmond star. Tyler James Williams stars as Chris. Executive producer and co-creator Ali LeRoi shares the science of casting in the DVD extras. Williams, a fairly unknown actor before the show, was a perfect fit because the audience could get to know him as Chris. Better than that, Williams was a real 13-year-old boy, awkwardness and all. Hakim, a Cleveland native, makes the perfect little sister because she looks like an ordinary neighborhood kid. \"I was happy because I came out of the ghetto and got this part,\" Hakim says in the extras. And Richmond just has that cooler younger brother look, Rock and LeRoi said. The comedy is loosely based on Rock's life, but it's no autobiography. Rock really has six brothers and one sister. On the show, he has two siblings. \"There's a portion of the show that reflects Chris' life, and it's really in the tone,\" LeRoi said. The 22-episode DVD release also includes cast and crew commentaries on select episodes, featurettes, bloopers, deleted scenes, set photos and audition reels. It's comedy and Chris Rock is involved, so of course, it's lots of fun. (Enhanced widescreen, 2005-06. not rated) DeAnne M. Bradley Although the Mormon Church banned polygamy in 1890, at least 40,000 people are thought to practice it and more may be watching it on cable. HBO continues its tradition of delivering the finest dramatic shows on television with \"Big Love: The Complete First Season\" (audio: ***1/2, video: ***1/2, extras: **1/2), an even-handed look at modern-day polygamy in Salt Lake City. Bill Paxton stars as the head of the family with three beautiful wives (Jeanne Tripplehorn, Chloe Sevigny, Ginnifer Goodwin), seven kids, and a thriving business. He has all the trouble three families would bring three mortgages, warring personalities, sexual dysfunction, and more. Harry Dean Stanton steals the show as the creepy backwoods patriarch of a polygamist commune. As is always the case with HBO, this five-disc set containing 12 episodes will run you a very steep $100. Extras are also thin for a set this highly priced. Three commentaries and a brief look at the creation of the opening title sequence are all viewers have to chew on. But if you want the best, you have to pay the price. (Enhanced wide-screen, 2006, unrated) - Josh Boone Eloise is an imp with a heart and her personality shines through on IDT Entertainment's new line of animated stories, including the new releases \"Me, Eloise\" and \"Eloise: Little Miss Christmas\" (both: audio: ***, video: ***, extras: ***). Staying true to the character's precociousness, the creators have made up great storylines that show Eloise's curious, creative personality and her ability to be inclusive and generous. In the first show, Eloise makes friends with an 8-year-old violin prodigy from Tokyo who moves into New York's famous Plaza Hotel. Eloise teaches Yuko and her parents that there is more to life than practicing the violin. In the Christmas show, Eloise and her Plaza pals go to great lengths in the face of many roadblocks to put on a yuletide show for some of New York's downtrodden. New characters are introduced, but they stay true to the fun and antics. Lynn Redgrave voices Nanny, Eloise's guardian when her mother's not around, and Tim Curry voices Plaza manager Mr. Salamone; both do fabulous jobs in those roles. The extras are quite fun, too. The menu is an elevator, and viewers push the floor buttons to access special features, including cartoon shorts and Plaza scenes. Other extras include a quick look at some of the shows' characters as narrated by Eloise, a different game on each of the DVDs and a look at sketches and the final animated product that run simultaneously on the screen it's pretty neat. Eloise creator Kay Thompson is rumored to have based her books on her own life, as well as that of her goddaughter, Liza Minelli and she would probably get a kick out of this version of her famous creation. (Both: Enhanced widescreen and fullscreen, 2006, not rated) - Toni Guagenti The bonus, in and of itself, is owning \"It's The Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown\" (audio: ****, video, ****, extras: *) on DVD. So don't get excited, because that story and a bonus feature, \"You're Not Elected, Charlie Brown,\" are all you get on this \"Peanuts Classic\" release. Watching Sally, Charlie Brown's sister, freak out on Linus after they miss Halloween camped out in the pumpkin patch waiting for the Great Pumpkin is hysterical. \"You blockhead!\" she screams at him, realizing she's missed out on the candy-collecting. Plus, she can't get any goodies from her brother, because all he got was rocks. This classic can be enjoyed over and over again. In the second feature, Charlie Brown doesn't get to run for class office because Lucy's unscientific polling discovers no one would vote for him. Poor Charlie Brown. But Linus gets a shot and almost blows it after promising the kids a visit from the Great Pumpkin as part of his platform. The colors pop on this DVD, including the vivid hues of Linus' red tee, Lucy's blue dress and Charlie Brown's yellow shirt. The music's in Dolby Digital, and Vince Guaraldi's score is perfect. (Fullscreen, 1966, not rated) Toni Guagenti Peter Bogdanovich's \"They All Laughed: 25th Anniversary Edition\" (audio: ***, video: ***, extras:***) features Audrey Hepburn in her final starring role in a theatrical film. Although both Quentin Tarantino and Wes Anderson consider it one of their favorite films of all time, it was a huge bomb when it was originally released and nearly destroyed Bogdanovich. Actress Dorothy Stratten was murdered after the film's shooting was completed and studios distanced themselves from the film, refusing to release it because of the bad publicity surrounding the tragedy. Bogdanovich put in $5 million of his own money and distributed the film himself. The shooting was also plagued by tension on the set between Hepburn and actor Ben Gazzara, who had recently split up with Hepburn to marry another woman. Twenty-five years have put enough distance between the behind-the-scenes drama to make it possible to appreciate this tremendously fun, if slight, screwball comedy about a team of detectives who get involved with two women they are investigating for suspected adultery. The DVD includes a video conversation between Bogdanovich and Anderson and a thoroughly enjoyable commentary by Bogdanovich. (Enhanced wide-screen, 1981, rated PG) - Josh Boone \"Numb3rs: The Complete Second Season\" (audio: ***, video: ***, extras: ***1/2) builds on the half-season that got the series off to a solid start. Forget struggles to de-randomize shooting sprees; mathematician Charlie Eppes (David Krumholtz) helps his brother Don (Rob Morrow) and other FBI agents solve arsons, stalkings and robberies this season. The set offers seven episodes with commentaries that run the gamut from lighthearted efforts that offer little insight (\"Obsession\") to discussions that provide a lot of technical information (\"Scorched,\" which talks about how they set up and film the fiery effects) to one that tackles the sensitive issue of how the creators mixed the issue of gang murders with David Sinclair (Alimi Ballard) in \"The O.G.\" That episode was problematic because the creators didn't want to link Sinclair, the show's key black agent, to gangs. He discusses his initial reaction to the episode and how his attitude changed after seeing the script and talking with the director. The other extras bloopers and two behind-the-scenes featurettes with Nicolas Falacci and Krumholtz aren't really worth viewing. (Enhanced widescreen, 2005-06, not rated but adult content for violence) L.A. Luebbert In \"Combat Diary: The Marines of Lima Company\" (audio: ***, video: ***, extras: ***) we get to see what it was like for one of the hardest-hit combat units in the war. Along with all their other gear, the Reserve unit from Columbus, Ohio, was equipped with home video cameras. This war documentary produced by A&E IndieFilms is raw. It is a firsthand account of what the real deal is in Iraq. The heat, the connection between the troops. The casualties. It is revealing to see the initial enthusiasm of the company and how that feeling changes as the reality of war sets in. For those who want to romanticize the war, it's not going to happen here. Wherever your political beliefs about the war in Iraq lie, watching this riveting DVD will show you another view from the vantage point of the warriors. Extras include bonus footage that was left out of the original offering. There is a very touching video greeting from a Marine who taped a birthday message to his daughter back home just a month before he was killed. There is also a slide show with commentary by three of the men who took the pictures and a biography/filmography of the director. (Enhanced widescreen, 2006, not rated but contains some very graphic material) Cliff Redding As \"That 70s Show: Season Five\" (audio: ***1/2, video: ***1/2, extras: **) gets rolling, Eric (Topher Grace), Donna (Laura Prepon), Kelso (Ashton Kutcher) and the gang are gearing up for their senior year of high school. For the series, much like many a star high-school athlete, it would be all downhill after that. But season five presents the cast and writing still in prime form and, arguably, at its peak of popularity. Guest appearances by Jessica Simpson and Luke Wilson, among others, help add spice to the goings-on. The set's weak lineup of extras continues an ongoing trend with this series. While the first couple of seasons feature some audio commentaries and other standard goodies, this set (and the previous two) includes a pair of rather weak featurettes sit-downs with Danny Masterson and Wilmer Valderrama as well as the original promos for each episode and \"Season 5 in 5 Minutes,\" which offers a quick rundown of the season's main story arcs. These sets could be much more impressive if only Fox would put a little bit of pride into their work. (Fullscreen, 2002, not rated) Robert Hatfield In \"Andy Milonakis: The Complete Second Season,\" (audio: ***, video: ***, extras: ****) the rapping Jewish kid from the Lower East Side only gets better. Part hidden-camera reality show, part sketch comedy and part, well, crazy, the MTV2 show thrives with a unique brand of comedy that's low-budget and childish think biting into a worm and finding an apple, or a tin-can phone that leaks creamed corn. This season Andy, who, because of a birth defect looks like a teenager but is in fact 30 years old, continues to terrorize old folks in the L.E.S and lampoon his dim-witted sidekick Ralphie. Fifteen extra skits are included each of them more silly and strange than the next as well as two music videos in which Andy does his cartoonish but surprisingly decent raps. Warning: This is only for the truly goofy it's like Tom Green drunk on soda. (Fullscreen, 2006, not rated) - Malcolm Venable When a TV show's title is too rude for print, it goes without saying that its content may be more than a little risque. The magician duo at the helm of \"Penn & Teller: Bulls**t! The Complete Third Season\" (audio: ***, video, ***, extras, no stars) certainly haven't run out of opinions to express or dubious claims to debunk. They are hostile to conspiracy theories, government intrusion, organized religion, self-help mumbo-jumbo, the paranormal and silly toupees which is to say, viewers never know whether they'll be entertained, offended, or both. In the raucous, profanity-laced third season, the Showtime show takes on hair obsessions, circumcision (you can imagine the visual aids employed), gun control, family values, life coaching, religious relics (such as the Virgin Mary grilled-cheese sandwich), the Endangered Species Act and America's relentless quest for the best. The show is sometimes cruel and bombastic, but so gleefully irreverent that it's hard to stay angry for long. How upset can you get with a show that dares to show exactly yes, exactly what a bikini wax entails? Although there's plenty to enjoy in the third season, there's nothing extra to cheer about on this three-disc set. The only goodies are a lame collection of publicity photos and a list of the duo's movie and TV credits no outtakes, extra footage or commentaries. Packaging three discs with no decent extras? As Penn Jillette would say, that's a load of well, you get the drift. (Fullscreen, 2005, not rated) Caroline Luzzatto Three minor Michael Caine films are out as part of 20th Century Fox's Cinema Classics Collection. The biggest disappointment is \"The Magus\" (audio: ***, video: ***, extras: **), based on John Fowles' bestselling novel. Fowles wrote the screenplay of this convoluted, pretentious movie, starring Caine as Nicholas, an English teacher assigned to a school on a little Greek island. When Nicholas meets an enigmatic character named Maurice (Anthony Quinn) who lives with a beautiful young woman (Candice Bergen), the weirdness begins. Meanwhile, Nicholas is involved in a troubled relationship with a stewardess (Anna Karina), who appears from time to time in flashbacks. What is actually going on in the story is anyone's guess. There are plays within plays, masquerades, hints of magic and insanity, replete with awkward, purple prose. The one extra on this disc is a somewhat interesting documentary on Fowles, containing interviews with his biographer, fans, a literature professor and his editor at Little, Brown. In discussing \"The Magus,\" Fowles' first novel, which took him 10 years to write, the prof sees the themes as true love and the meaning of life. His editor calls him the \"best prose stylist of the 20th century.\" (Enhanced wide screen, 1968, rated PG) In \"Deadfall\" (audio: ***, video: ***, extras: **1/2), Caine is a jewel thief who is sucked into an elaborate heist scheme with an unlikely married couple. There is enough going on in this (comparatively) well-written film to keep it interesting. One special feature offers the isolated score, composed by John Barry. There is also a documentary on Barry and his illustrious career. The English composer was responsible for the James Bond soundtracks, \"Out of Africa,\" \"Body Heat,\" \"The Lion in Winter,\" and hundreds more. Barry has a bit part in \"Deadfall\" as the conductor of a beautiful guitar symphony he composed. (Enhanced wide screen, 1968, rated R for nudity and sexual situations) \"Peeper\" (audio: **, video: ***, extras: **) stars Caine as Leslie Tucker, an L.A. private eye in 1947, hired by an eccentric wealthy man to find his adult daughter, who had been adopted as a child, so he can give her her rightful inheritance. Tucker finds the right family but isn't sure which of the daughters (played by Natalie Wood and Kitty Winn) is the lucky one. This spoof of a film noir is mildly entertaining, but definitely a grade B-minus. Extras include an interview with the director, Peter Hyams, who confesses to being a \"Raymond Chandler freak.\" Hyams refers to the box office failure of the film as one of the \"scars\" in his life. In another, much more enjoyable, extra, film noir is examined in general. Clips from classic '40s movies are shown, as are more modern ones from the \"rebirth\" of the genre, with examples like \"Chinatown\" and \"Taxi Driver.\" (Enhanced widescreen, 1975, rated PG) Peggy Earle",

Home Video. THERE WAS A TIME when studios relied on novels loved by a well-read audience as a source for movie magic. We now can find a brilliant sampling of these inspired gems in Warner Brothers' five-disc set: \"Motion Picture Masterpieces Collection: 'David Copperfield' (1935), 'Marie Antoinette' (1938), 'Pride and Prejudice' (1940), 'A Tale of Two Cities' (1935) and 'Treasure Island' (1934)\" (audio, ***, video, ***, extras, *** ). Each disc includes vintage cartoons and featurettes for a full night at the movies. Many of these, such as \"Strikes and Spares,\" were Oscar-nominated. Today they are far from PC and unintentionally funny. The real prizes are the films. No one has ever played Sydney Carton better than Ronald Colman in \"A Tale of Two Cities.\" Colman's Carton is a charmer: Men like him, women love him and his sacrifice still brings tears. Elizabeth Allan, in the role of Lucie Manette, is incandescent. She plays such a kindly character, a beacon of decency. It would have been so easy to go over the top, but she doesn't. Basil Rathbone is in fine form as the evil Marquis St. Evremonde. He also shows up as the equally villainous Edward Murdstone in \"David Copperfield,\" along with W.C. Fields and Freddy Bartholomew. There is a great game in watching these classics back to back and spotting reappearing actors: Maureen O'Sullivan, Edna May Oliver, the Barrymores and others. (All: Black and white, full-screen, not rated) Kay Reynolds Inline image:VirginianPilot-quotHD-DVD jacket for \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\" from Warner Bros. Home Video. Tim Burton's \"Corpse Bride\" and \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\" (both: audio: ****, video: ****, extras: ****) look spectacular in their new HD presentation. Images are sharp and colors are distinct on new screens and old. And viewers, young and old, should find this a delight. Burton has developed a repertoire of actors, including Johnny Depp, Christopher Lee and Helena Bonham Carter, all featured players in both films. Danny Elfman brings his distinctive touch to each very musical score. \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\" offers the \"In-Movie Experience\" among its extras. Hosted by an Oompa-Loompa, you can watch special background material as the film runs. Unfortunately, the \"Experience\" provides nothing you can't find among the various documentaries. It also takes you all the way back to the beginning of the film if switched on while the movie is in progress. \"Corpse Bride\" offers the same extras available on the original DVD release and are still great fun to watch. Elfman offers his interpretation of the music he composed for the human world and the Underworld. A music-only track enhances his description and might make great Halloween party background. \"Corpse Bride\" is also available in Blu-ray. Fans of the original Candy Man, Gene Wilder, will be pleased to see David L. Wolper's \"Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory\" (audio: ****, video: ****, extras: ***) is also available on glorious HD. Both the Burton and Wolper treatment of Roald Dahl's book are worth viewing and fun to compare. Original features include a book to screen documentary and sing-along videos. Commentary from the child actors is filled with anecdotes. (Burton films: HD widescreen, 2005. \"Corpse Bride\" rated PG for some scary images and action, and brief, mild language. \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\" rated PG for quirky situations, action and brief, mild language. \"Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory\": HD widescreen, 1971, rated G.) Kay Reynolds Inline image:VirginianPilot-quot Adam Sandler may be Hollywood's surest bet. Five of his last six movies have nearly doubled their profits. His latest is \"Click,\" (audio: ****, video: ****, extras: ** ) which is available in DVD and Blu-ray as the first 50-gigabyte disc. It worked flawlessly on my Samsung BD player. Sandler plays Michael Newman, a workaholic architect with two kids and a beautiful wife (Kate Beckinsale), who finds himself enslaved to his dozen remotes which control every gadget under the roof. Trying to simplify his life, Michael needs a universal remote. First stop, Best Buy. It's closed. He then wanders into Bed Bath and Beyond and meets Morty (Christopher Walken) behind a mysterious door in the workshop and is given the ultimate remote. This truly magical gadget starts controlling Michael's life. He can pause a scene, mute the barking dog, skip life's bad stuff and reverse to his birth. What he discovers is he's missing out on life. Trying to bridge the gap between another juvenile Sandler comedy and Frank Capra's \"It's a Wonderful Life,\" \"Click\" quickly becomes sappy and predictable, so keep your remote handy to fast-forward to the end. The disc includes a commentary with director Frank Coraci, college bud of Sandler at NYU, executive producer Tim Herlihy, screenwriter Steve Koren and Sandler. During the commentary, they brag about shooting on high-def video, not film, making it their format of choice. Also, the half-dozen short documentaries are in HD, highlighting the makeup process Sandler becoming old and fat special effects and more. (HD widescreen, 2006, PG-13 for language, crude and sex-related humor and some drug references) Bill Kelley III Inline image:VirginianPilot-quot Finally, an A-list movie worthy of everyone's HD-DVD collection. \"Batman Begins\" (audio: ****, video: ****, extras: ** ) gets the epic treatment, similar to Richard Donner's \"Superman: The Movie\" with Christopher Reeves playing the Man of Steel which is planned for HD-DVD and Blu-ray this November. Brit director Christopher Nolan (\"Memento\" and \"Insomnia\") gives this comic book classic an emotional core that previous \"Batman\" movies clearly missed telling Bruce Wayne's origins, a young boy tormented by his fears. Too bad the HD disc has such an uninspired pop-up video commentary. The short clips just highlight the eight documentaries. You can watch them in their entirety in the bonus section. That's where you'll get Nolan's complete journey spending weeks in a back room off his garage, working with co-writer David S. Goyer, translating the tale. They were so secretive; they gave \"Batman Begins\" an alias \"Intimidation Game\" and studio execs had to spend the afternoon between the washer and dryer reading the script for the first time. The other documentaries are quite informative including Christian Bale's training and rehearsing becoming the superhero; costume design for the Batsuit; creation of the Batmobile; filming in Iceland the world beyond Gotham City; CGI and production design of Gotham, Batcave and Wayne Manor. The disc also includes the uncompressed Dolby TrueHD track for exceptional dynamic range, the clearest digital sound possible surpassing your DVD and anything at the multiplex. (HD widescreen, 2005, PG-13 for intense action violence, disturbing images and some thematic elements) Bill Kelley III Two previous Warner Bros. HD-DVDs premiere on Blu-ray (BD) this week. Warner is one of three studios supporting both HD formats which aren't compatible with each other. It's 8:02 a.m., New York City Detective Jack Mosley (Bruce Willis), a repetitious drunk, has one more job before heading home: transport petty criminal Eddie Bunker (Mos Def), \"16 Blocks\" (audio: ****, video: ****, extras: *1/2) from the precinct stationhouse to the courthouse, by 10 a.m. Oblivious to the hung-over detective, hired assassins are on his tail, to stop motormouth Bunker from testifying against one of NYC's worst cops and his co-horts which includes Mosley. For the next 100 minutes, you're in for a wild ride through Manhattan especially after Mosley's pit stop at his favorite liquor store exposing Bunker to the killers. The BD discs sports an identical crystal-clear picture as the HD-DVD, but just like its high def cousin, it can't seamlessly insert the shocking alternate ending which worked perfectly on the DVD. \"It's the ending we intended, once we started filming,\" says director Richard Donner (\"Superman\" \"Lethal Weapon\"). The theatrical edit, is really the \"alternate\" ending, says Donner and writer Richard Wenk. The duo provided a commentary for 20 minutes of deleted scenes as they explain how each ended up on the cutting room floor. Rapper/actor Mos Def's performance is quite good, making this buddy flick worth a spin on your BD or HD-DVD player. (HD widescreen, 2006, PG-13 for violence, intense sequences of action, and some strong language) Bill Kelley III Oil is the drug of the 21st Century and governments the new cartels in \"Syriana\" (audio: ***, video: ****, extras: ***). And the battle is only just beginning. Whether viewing in BD or HD-DVD, don't skip the interviews. Director/writer Stephen Gaghan of \"Traffic\" and former CIA operative Robert \"Bob\" Baer penned this nonpartisan testimony to the strategies of big oil. Baer is a fascinating been-there-done-that speaker who puts a face on complicated issues. It would be great to hear more from him. \"Syriana\" is as complicated as its subject and best viewed without distraction. Follow a rogue agent who runs with the wolves of change in Beirut. An economist's family tragedy creates a bond with an idealistic prince. Two major oil companies explore merger. A desperate young man is wooed by a charismatic cultist. Shadow operatives plot who will inherit after an old man's death. Blink and you lose a thread. Like \"Traffic,\" individual storylines weave together to a powerful climax. George Clooney earned a Best Supporting Oscar for his mirror-role as CIA agent Bob Barnes. He is supported by an outstanding cast including Matt Damon, Christopher Plummer, Jeffrey Wright, Kayvan Novak, Amr Waked, Chris Cooper, and Alexander Siddig. (HD widescreen, 2005, R for violence and language.) Kay Reynolds Inline image:VirginianPilot-quot What would you do if your child was in the back seat of your car when it got hijacked? Well, that is the premise of \"Waist Deep\" (audio: ***1/2, video: ***1/2, extras: **). This gritty, urban film (directed by Vonde Curtis Hall) is about an ex-con (Tyrese), who is trying to do the right thing by raising his son and keeping in the good graces at his security job. He's trying to be a regular Joe, albeit in the hood, when his son winds up in the hands of some Los Angeles gang members. Tyrese, O2, is forced to get down and dirty in order to get his son back. O2 has to come up with $100,000 to get Junior back. And by doing so, O2 has to resort to his criminal side. The action is somewhat predictable, although entertaining. The film also stars Larenz Tate and Meagan Good. Extras include a making-of featurette titled \"Drive-by Filmmaking,\" deleted scenes and a \"slamming\" music video by Black Buddafly featuring Fabolous. Also, \"Waist Deep\" is available as a comb disc, HD one side and DVD on the other with the extras. (HD widescreen & enhanced widescreen, 2006, R for strong violence and pervasive language ) Cliff Redding Fans of the third chapter in the \"X-Men\" saga who don't want to shell out $30 for the collector's edition will enjoy the standard version of \"X3: The Last Stand\" (audio: ****, video: ***1/2, extras: **1/2). Thou, it doesn't include Stan Lee's custom comic book the extras included aren't too shabby. The DVD comes with two commentaries from director Brett Ratner and screenwriters Simon Kinberg and Zak Penn and the second from the producers. The commentaries do have a nice sarcastic tone, at one point making mention of the difficulty Ben Foster had growing wings for his role as Angel. The deleted scenes are a nice addition. They range from alternate takes (one including a bearded Magneto), to extended scenes (for instance, the cool fight scene at Jean Grey's house) and three alternate endings. The deleted scenes are by far the best of the extras. This is not a bad buy for any fan of the movie. (Enhanced widescreen, 2006, PG-13 for intense sequences of action violence, some sexual content and language) Brian Shapiro Sitcoms lasting more than a season or two tend to follow a similar trajectory. They start off a little off-kilter, pick up a great deal of steam that can last for two to three seasons and then begin cooling off. There are few exceptions. \"Scrubs: Season Four\" (audio ***1/2, video ****, extras ***) is one of those exceptions. The top-shelf ensemble cast remains as top-to-bottom funny as ever. Season four's string of guest stars (Heather Graham, Colin Farrell, Matthew Perry and Molly Shannon, to name a few) remains impressive and adds just enough spice to an already-tasty mix. The writing by this point has become a tad redundant, but certainly not enough to hamper the laugh fest. If anything sullies this release, it's the recent Scrubs syndication deal that puts episodes on a number of channels (most notably Comedy Central) every evening of the week. Still, season four highlights like \"My Boss' Free Haircut\", which showcases the brilliant Ken Jenkins as Dr. Kelso, and \"My Life in Four Cameras\" which briefly re-imagines the series as filmed like a traditional sitcom redeem this set. A reasonably worthwhile batch of extras is highlighted by \"Will You Be My Mentor,\" which chronicles JD's (Zach Braff) seemingly endless quest for Dr. Cox's (John C. McGinley) approval. Also worth checking out are a witty look at Neil Flynn's janitor character, entitled \"Who Is This Man?\" and \"The Weapons Chest,\" which celebrates the series' \"second string\" cast members, most notably Sam Lloyd, who plays the flop-sweat drenched hospital lawyer, Ted. A pair of commentaries help round out an otherwise forgettable remaining string of features. (Fullscreen, 2005, not rated) Robert Hatfield Though well-directed and acted, \"The King\" (audio: ***1/2, video: ***1/2, extras: **1/2) is a gut-wrenching film with few redeeming qualities that I would have a hard time recommending to anyone. Gael Garcia Bernal (\"Y Tu Mama Tambien,\" \"The Science of Sleep\"), one of the most gifted actors working today, gives a chilling performance as Elvis, the illegitimate son of a Texas preacher (played by William Hurt). After a stint in the Navy he shows up in Corpus Christi and attempts to be a part of his father's life, who wants nothing to do with him since he fathered him before he became a Christian. This pushes Elvis over the edge and he murders Hurt's teenage son and seduces and impregnates his sixteen-year-old daughter, who also happens to be his half sister. This is just the beginning of the nastiness you'll see in \"The King.\" It's a bad sign when the DVD includes a letter from the filmmakers who feel they need to defend their film instead of allowing it to speak for itself. The biggest problem with \"The King\" is that we never get inside Elvis's head to understand his actions. He takes on a detached and malevolent aura and almost seems to represent Satan, who has come to destroy this God fearing family. The DVD includes a commentary with writer/producer Milo Addica and writer/director James Marsh and deleted scenes. Though the film has failures on a writing level, I applaud the filmmakers for portraying a Christian family without making them look like clowns. (Enhanced widescreen, 2005, R for strong sexuality involving a teen, violence and language) Josh Boone \"Bad Santa\" (audio: ***, video: ***, extras: ***) is not your usual Christmas story. Billy Bob Thornton is an alcolholic, womanizer who poses as Santa, and, with the help of his \"Little Helper\" (played by Tony Cox), makes a living by ripping off department stores on Christmas Eve. Their scam is working, until Thornton's Willie gets his heart tugged by a troubled little boy who gets under his skin. To add to the chaos, the store's security boss (Bernie Mac) is onto the duo's scam. Thornton's Willie is ridiculous as the Santa from hell, hitting on women in plain view of the kids, showing up to work drunk. Image the most obnoxious person you can think of. Now imagine them in a Santa Claus suit . and multiply that by 50. John Ritter even turns in a funny performance (one of his last) as Bob Chipeska, store manager. Extras include a making-of featurette, deleted and alternate scenes, and commentary with the film's editor, Robert Hoffman, and director Terry Zwigoff. (Enhanced widescreen, 2003, rated R for language and adult situations) Cliff Redding Ridley Scott faced many challenges while filming \"Black Rain: Special Collector's Edition\" (audio: ***1/2, video: ***1/2, extras: ***1/2) in Japan. He had so much trouble getting the locations he wanted and the time he needed to shoot there that a surprising amount of footage ended up being shot back in the states. Michael Douglas and Andy Garcia play New York cops who find themselves in the middle of a gang war between the Yakuza and the Japanese Mafia. Scott's signature look (perfected in \"Blade Runner\" and \"Alien\") are on display and this marks Scott's first collaboration with composer Hans Zimmer. The DVD features a stunning new transfer, showing none of the print damage evident in the earlier bare bones release. Extras include a commentary by Scott and roughly an hour of documentaries covering the film's frustrating production, the editing process (the film was whittled down from nearly three hours) and the reaction of critics after the film's release. Paramount has done a terrific job. Ridley Scott fans take note. (Enhanced widescreen, 1989, R for violence and language) Josh Boone Out of sensitivity to the feelings of Americans less than five years after Sept. 11, the \"CSI:NY\" creators waited until the end of season two to deal with a bomb blast in a building and also had a back story that made \"Charge of This Post\" about more than just a possible terrorist attack. That is one of the things viewers will learn on the extras with \"CSI - NY: The Complete Second Season\" (audio: ***1/2, video: ***, extras: ***1/2). The back story, including flashbacks by Mac Taylor (Gary Sinise) to his time as a Marine during the Beirut bombing, was one part of a series of changes for season two. It allowed for a broadening of character development. Another big change is season two was the general atmosphere, going from dark to lighter. Most of the commentaries at least touch on this, and there are features that examine some of the changes, including ones to the set and cast. (Enhanced widescreen, 2005-06, not rated but some violence and adult issues such as rape) L.A. Luebbert Maybe Disney was too busy putting together \"The Little Mermaid: Platinum Edition\" to worry about upgrading or beefing up its 25th anniversary edition of \"The Fox and the Hound\" (audio: **1/2, video: **1/2, extras: ***). Regardless, this little ditty about a fox named \"Tod\" and a hound named \"Copper\" is a sweet tale about friendship, even though the two when they meet as youngsters don't know they're mortal enemies. Bonus features aren't new and are typical Disney with a \"Forest Friendship Game,\" where you find Tod or match other forest creatures with their best friends; a story read-along or read-alone extra; \"The Fox and the Hound\" art gallery; two Disney old shorts, \"Lambert The Sheepish Lion\" and \"Lend a Paw,\" nice stories about acceptance and friendship; and \"The Best of Friends\" sing-along song crooned by the late, great Pearl Bailey, the voice of Big Mama (owl) in the movie. Although it's short, \"Passing the Baton: The Making Of The Fox and the Hound\" featurette explains why this movie marked the studio's rise once again to the top of the animation world. It talks about Walt Disney's famous \"Nine Old Men,\" animators that made \"Snow White\" and \"Bambi\" such masterpieces, as they handed over the reigns to new artists during the making of \"The Fox and the Hound.\" A connection to \"The Little Mermaid\" in this featurette: two of the movie's animators went on to score big with Ariel and the gang eight years later Ron Clements and John Musker both co-directors and writers on the mermaid movie. (Fullscreen, 1981, rated G) Toni Guagenti Since NBC put the addictive Emmy-winning show's third season on hold, fans will have to be satisfied watching \"Medium: The Complete Second Season\" (audio: ***, video: ***1/2, extras: ***) until new episodes start running. (Soon, please!) Patricia Arquett, Jake Weber, Miguel Sandoval and David Cubitt return for 22 fascinating episodes here along with some top-notch guest stars, such as Molly Ringwald and David Carradine. Returning regulars include Connor O'Farrell as the shifty defense attorney, Ryan Hurst as the Medium's brother, psycho/psychic killer Mark A. Sheppard, and Arliss Howard as Capt. Kenneth Push, who brings a rip-snorting showdown to Season One's end season cliffhanger and second season opener, \"When Push Comes to Shove.\" We also get to see executive producer Kelsey Grammer take a turn as the Angel of Death in \"Death Takes a Policy.\" He is absolutely perfect as always. The beauty of \"Medium's\" mysteries is that they are mysterious. They are great puzzlers that challenge your smarts, without resorting to trickery. Viewers get the same clues as our heroine and her companions. (Viewers also get two pair of 3-D glasses enclosed in this 6-disc set, the better to watch the 3-D episode, \"Sill Life 2-D,\" where paintings take on a life their own. A 2-D version of the episode is also included.) Happily, viewers can enjoy Season 2 without having seen the first season. The series follows the trials and victories of Allison DuBois, a woman who helps solve crimes using intuition, dreams and some spontaneous mind reading. \"Medium\" packs more punch, heart and believability than \"Ghost Whisperer.\" Extras include scattered commentaries by creator/writer Glenn Gordon Caron (\"Moonlighting\") and others. Caron is also featured in the documentaries that cover Season 2 highlights and the 3-D episode. Fans of the young actresses who play the DuBois daughters, Sofia Vassilleva and Maria Lark, can enjoy a \"A Day in the Life\" featurette. (Enhanced widescreen, 2, not rated, but beware of adult themes and implied violence) Kay Reynolds A sentimental love story in an unusual setting \"Changing Times\" (audio: ***, video: ***, extras: **) was directed by Andre Techine and stars Catherine Deneuve and Gerard Depardieu, both stars (shall we say) slightly the worse for wear. In the story, the two had been passionate lovers in their youth. Thirty years later, Antoine (Depardieu) finds a way, via his work, to go to Tangiers, where he knows Cecile (Deneuve) lives. She is married to a younger man and has a grown son. Antoine, who had never married, nor forgotten Cecile, begins to send anonymous bouquets of roses to her at the radio station where she works. Eventually, he presents himself and she completely rejects him and sends him on his way. But her marriage is falling apart and the very predictable happens. Thanks to the high caliber of the acting and directing, this otherwise-sappy story is very watchable. The only special feature is an interview with the actor Gilbert Melki, who plays the younger husband. He discusses the way Techine directs with \"no psychology\" and \"no improvising.\" Everything in the film, which was shot on location, had been written into the script, albeit sometimes immediately before the shooting. (Enhanced widescreen, 2004, unrated) The makers of \"Ghost World\" have conspired in another cynical, funny film: \"Art School Confidential\" (audio: ***1/2, video: ****, extras: ***). Written by Daniel Clowes and directed by Terry Zwigoff (\"Crumb\"), it stars Max Minghella (the director Anthony's son), Sophia Myles, John Malkovich, Anjelica Huston and Jim Broadbent. Though not as pitch-perfect as \"Ghost World,\" this hits nerves often and funny bones even more. A young, sexually inexperienced man (Minghella) is a freshman at the fictional Strathmore (for art insiders, that's the brand of many art supplies) College in New York City. He gets quick doses of reality when it comes to girls, the art world, and his artistic heroes. A sub-plot concerns a serial killer stalking people on the college campus. Extras include a making-of documentary, in which Clowes says the story is autobiographical: \"Art school was, to me, what Vietnam was to Oliver Stone!\" A Sundance featurette includes brief interviews with all the actors at the Utah resort where the film had its world premiere this year. There are deleted scenes, a blooper reel and alternate takes of a scene with Malkovich. (Enhanced widescreen, 2005, R for language, nudity and violence) Peggy Earle Comedian Carlos Mencia will get you laughing . and living. And in \"Carlos Mencia: No Strings Attached\" (audio: ***, video: ***; extras: ***), the man brilliantly picks on each and every ethnic group: blacks, Asians, Middle Easterners, whites and of course Latinos. Mencia is merciless in his delivery during two offerings (actually three) of his stand-up routine. There is one that was taped for a Comedy Central \"One Night Stand in New York\" a little while after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, where he gets all over us in America for being, well, American. The humor is raw and not for the tenderhearted, but the man is funny. FUNNY, when you stop long enough to ponder what he is really say. In his more-recent \"No Strings Attached\" performance, Mencia even gets MORE raw with his brand of ethnic humor. He even picks on the pope. The pope AND Mother Teresa, as well as members of the groups previously named. The coolest thing about this DVD is that there are two versions of the \"Attached\" appearance, which was filmed in San Francisco. The first version is the one that the public saw on Comedy Central, the \"tamer\" of the two versions (and Comedy Central is not one known for being tame, you know). The second version gets more nasty. More \"insensitive\" (to some) and even more obnoxious. This is the extended, director's cut version, and Mencia manages to raise a few eyebrows here. He even seems to surprise himself by how far he goes with one of his routines. How about that, ladies and gentlemen? Extras on this DVD include the \"Comedy Central Presents: Carlos Mencia\" performance and a featurette on the making of the ridiculously cool chopper that Mencia rides onto the stage on in \"No Strings.\" (Fullscreen, 2006, not rated but this DVD is for mature audiences only. Trust me on this.) Cliff Redding Television in the 1980s was as much about escapism as TV in the 21st century is about reality. From \"Magnum P.I.\" to the \"A-Team,\" series weren't gruesome in detail or about neighbors or siblings fighting in front of a live audience. That's why watching \"Simon & Simon: Season One\" (audio: ***, video: ***, extras: ) brought back memories of a time when sitting in the recliner was a respite from the realities of the world. If you want to return to the campy, un-ultra-special- effects era, when A.J. (Jameson Parker) and Rick (Gerald McRaney, \"Major Dad\") chased bad guys from San Diego to Tijuana and back again, and when the guns when they did go off didn't sound quite real, this four-disc set is for you. Don't buy it for the extras. There's one recycled piece, \"The Great '80s Flashback,\" which has some great interviews from TV reporters, critics and '80s actors, but it can be found on some releases of 1980s' shows on DVD. So here's to the odd-couple brothers and the creators of \"Simon & Simon,\" who gave us some good shows in a simpler TV lifetime. (Fullscreen, 1981, not rated) Toni Guagenti Cynthia McKinney: conspiracy kook or civil champion? In \"American Blackout\" (audio: ***, video: ***, extras: **) the former Georgia congresswoman is painted the small, discredited cog in a wider system misleading Americans and the media. The film, which won six film awards including one at Sundance, details McKinney's questioning of Bush's Florida win in 2000, which coincided with thousands of black voters being wrongly identified as felons at the polls. We see her turned into a wacko when, days after the 9-11 attacks, she hints that the government had some prior warnings. We watch Republicans flood the Democratic primary to ouster her in her own party, and then see her, after the 2004 election, wonder aloud why black voters in Ohio were made to wait in long lines in the rain to vote, only to be turned away. It's short on extras, they're good. The anonymous interview with black Capitol Hill Police makes you wonder if her infamous scuffle with Cap Hill Police was about something much bigger. It's the \"Fahrenheit 9-11\" of black voting. (Fullscreen, 2006, not rated) Malcolm Venable Nowadays, you get spoiled by overactive DVD menus and computer-generated animation that makes characters look, well, computer-generated. With the ability to mass-produce this stuff, some characters don't last as long as the series they're supposed to star in. It's nice when TV land resurrects an oldie but a goodie, which the former WB did with \"Tom and Jerry Tales,\" (audio: ***, video: ***1/2, extras: 0) on DVD with 12 cartoons from the new TV series on The CW (The WB merged with UPN to form CW, for those of you who didn't know). Sure, the menu doesn't have music and Tom and Jerry don't bounce all over the screen begging the viewer to push a button on the DVD remote. Nonetheless, the 12 shows are fairly true to the heart of the cat-and-mouse team animated slapstick in the old pen-and-ink fashion that have made the duo popular off and on for decades since their debut with MGM in the 1930s. The DVD's cover makes it seem like a holiday DVD, but the majority of shows deals with t",

                "text": "Local chapters of the National Wild Turkey Federation annually host events for the young members of their clubs. Like young male turkeys, the children are affectionately known in federation circles as \"jakes.\" The Tidewater Chapter of the National Wild Turkey Federation last weekend joined with chapters in Suffolk and Wakefield to host the fourth annual Jakes Day at the Bronco Club in Southampton County. More than 30 boys and girls 16 and younger were treated to a day of learning. \"It was wet and windy but pretty wild,\" said Pete Costenbader, president of the Tidewater chapter. Mike Arrington and Robbie Taylor of the Suffolk and Wakefield clubs were the event's main organizers, Costenbader said. \"We usually have about 50 or so kids each year, but this was in the midst of the worst part of that storm,\" Costenbader said. \"It's kind of amazing anybody showed up.\" Those who did got a good education in things such as archery, skeet shooting, marksmanship, fishing and tracking animals. Tommy Baharm, a pro staffer for Primos Hunting Calls, discussed and demonstrated various turkey calls. Costenbader added that Arrington had arranged for prizes such as turkey calls and gun cases for all participating \"jakes.\" Flounder update: The National Marine Fisheries Service has released its flounder catch information for July and August. The figures confirm that Virginia flounder anglers have greatly exceeded their targeted catch for 2006. Virginia was given a target of 616,000 flounder for 2006. Through the end of August, anglers had landed 793,083 flounder. While landings for September through the end of the year generally are low, it is almost certain that Virginia recreational anglers will top 800,000 pounds for the year. That could spell trouble for Virginia anglers next year when fisheries managers must implement a federal order to reduce the entire East Coast catch. According to Rob O'Reilly, assistant chief of fisheries for the Virginia Marine Resources Commission, the service is leaning toward a 2007 reduction of 40 percent to 50 percent from 2006. Exceeding the state catch limit this year could push Virginia's forced reduction toward the high end of that scale. Virginia anglers next year will see lower bag limits, longer minimum lengths, and possibly some season closures. The federal reduction is being ordered to help a continuing plan of helping the East Coast flounder population rebound from about 18,000 pounds in the 1980s to approximately 200,000 pounds in 2010. The VMRC will not be able to start working on several rules options until the final federal numbers are released by the NMFS. Record certified: The 116.5-pound cobia caught in June by Billy Ray Lucas has been certified as an 80-pound line-class world record by the International Game Fish Association. Lucas, of Wilson, N.C., caught the giant just off the Salvo beach. The fight took about 30 minutes. Lucas' fish is now the North Carolina state saltwater cobia record. The 71-inch-long, 32-inch-girth fish is thought to be the fifth-largest cobia ever caught on a rod and reel. Nature's fireworks: Stargazers wanting to catch one of the best meteor showers of the year should look to the eastern sky during the middle of the night next weekend. The Orionids meteor showers are expected to peak around 1 a.m. Saturday. During the peak, observers can expect to see 20 to 40 meteors an hour. The showers will be most visible about halfway between the horizon to overhead. Committee meeting: The Virginia Saltwater Fishing Tournament Committee will meet later this month to discuss possible program changes. The tournament honors anglers for trophy-sized catches and releases of fish meeting minimum standards for a variety of species. Anglers receive their choice of plaques or certificates. The meeting will be held at 6:45 p.m. Oct. 25 in the swimming pool lounge at Marina Shores in Virginia Beach. There will be a brief period for public comment before the meeting. Two of the most important aspects of the meeting each year are potential changes to the minimum standards for awards. Flounder and spot are two of the fish that will receive most of the attention at this year's meeting. There also is a proposal to add blueline tilefish to the awards program. Anglers fishing off Virginia recorded four world records for the species this year. For more information, call .

Lake Taylor, led by RBs George McInnis and Jeremie Simmons, is averaging 217.3 rushing yards per game; Indian River, guided by QB Dravon Poitillo and a cast of talented receivers, is averaging 189.8 through the air. The Braves have followed each victory this season with a loss. Indian River defeated Nansemond River last week. Lake Taylor has won back-to-back games since a loss to Maury. Jami says: Titans flex muscle on the ground. Lake Taylor, 23-20. Larry says: Titans facing must-win games. Lake Taylor, 27-20.

                "text": "Norfolk State at Hampton When: 1:30 p.m. Where: Armstrong Stadium, Hampton Records: Norfolk State, 3-2, 1-2 MEAC; Hampton, 6-0, 4-0. Radio: 88.1 FM, 91.1 FM About Norfolk State: The Spartans hope to bounce back from a 47-10 loss at South Carolina State last weekend with their first-ever win over a I-AA ranked opponent. QB Casey Hansen was sacked five times by the Bulldogs but still leads the MEAC in passing (192 ypg). He has thrown four TD passes but also eight INTs. RB Monte' Anthony has 342 yards and six TDs, and WR James Callaham has 16 catches for 183 yards. LB Maguell Davis has a team-high 31 tackles. The Spartans have committed 10 turnovers and caused three. About Hampton: The Pirates are No. 12 in the Sports Network's I-AA national poll and have won 23 consecutive regular-season games. Hampton has won the teams' past four meetings and 12 of the past 14 and are 4-1 at home against NSU since joining the MEAC in 1995. RB Alonzo Coleman has 446 yards and five touchdowns while his \"backup,\" Kevin Beverly, has 399 yards and five scores. QB Princeton Shepherd has thrown for 923 yards and 11 touchdowns, against one interception. LB Justin Durant has 55 tackles and K Andrew Paterini has converted 8 of 12 field goals. Wake Forest at N.C. State When: Noon Where: Carter-Finley Stadium; Raleigh, N.C. TV: WGNT Radio: 96.7 FM Records: Wake Forest 5-1, 1-1 ACC; N.C. State 3-2, 2-0. About Wake Forest: The Demon Deacons are better than they've been in a long time. But usually mediocre Wake got a lesson in closing the deal last week, when a field goal in the third quarter would've put the Deacs up 17 on No. 12 Clemson. Instead, a botched snap was six the other way, sparking a Tigers' comeback. Wake thinks it ought to be 6-0 and atop the Atlantic Division, and has a chance to pick up that sixth win (and bowl eligibility) as well as get back into the division race. The Deacs rank 14th nationally in scoring defense, allowing less than two touchdowns per game. Offensively, they're led by freshman QB Riley Skinner, the ACC's most efficient passer (68.4 percent completions, 4 TDs and 1 INT). About N.C. State: Since flopping against Akron and Southern Miss, the Wolfpack has been perfect in conference play, knocking off ACC big boys Boston College and Florida State the past two weeks. A win here will keep State in sole possession of first place in the Atlantic and completely cool the \"Fire Chuck Amato\" talk that heated up last month. QB Daniel Evans has been a key. Since taking over for struggling Marcus Stone, Evans has engineered two wins, throwing for 369 yards, four TDs and only one pick. He's helped by RB Andre Brown, who's averaging 6.4 yards a carry. Still, State needs to up the output, as the Pack ranks 90th or worse nationally in scoring, passing yards and total offense. Favorite: N.C. State by 3 Florida State at Duke When: 1 p.m. Where: Wallace Wade Stadium; Durham, N.C. Records: Florida State 3-2, 1-2 ACC; Duke 0-5, 0-3. Outlook: The Seminoles may be sub-.500 in the league for the first time since Bobby Bowden discovered the word \"dadgum,\" but FSU are heavy favorites to creep back to even against the hapless Blue Devils. The 'Noles will try to strengthen their running game, which ranks 87th in the nation, and should bury an inept Duke offense. While the Seminoles rank 17th in run defense and 18th in total defense nationally, the Devils are 100th or worse in every major offensive category. FSU figures to tee off on true freshman QB Thaddeus Lewis and Duke should remain winless. Favorite: Florida State by 22-1/2 Maryland at Virginia When: 3:30 p.m. Where: Scott Stadium, Charlottesville Records: Maryland 3-2, 0-1 ACC; Virginia 2-4, 1-1. Radio: 850 AM About Maryland: The Terps pushed Georgia Tech to the brink before falling 27-23 in Atlanta last week. TB Lance Ball rushed for 116 yards, Maryland's first 100-yard effort this year. The offense has been slow getting started, averaging 305 yards and 22 points a game, even with coach Ralph Friedgen taking on coordinator duties. Turnovers have hurt. Maryland ranks 10th in the ACC and 114th in the nation in TO margin. QB Sam Hollenbach has just five TD passes and the WRs are young. Look for Maryland to ride Ball, who rushed for 163 yards against Virginia last year. Adam Podlesh, one of the best punters in the ACC, gives Maryland a possible edge in the field-position game. The defense has been vulnerable against the run (169 ypg), but better against the pass, with a veteran secondary leading the way. Maryland has not won in Charlottesville since 1990. About Virginia: As poorly as the season has gone, Virginia is 1-1 in the ACC and is looking at this three-game homestand as a fresh start. If the Cavaliers are to salvage something of the season, this is the time to begin. Virginia has won seven straight over Maryland at home and 11 of the past 14 overall. After taking a step forward with a convincing win over Duke, Virginia took two steps back in last week's loss at East Carolina. The Cavs allowed a season-high 432 yards, including 208 on the ground. Still, the defense is No. 32 in the nation. DEs Chris Long and Jeffrey Fitzgerald are two of the best in the ACC and LB Jon Copper has been productive. The Cavaliers need better play up the middle and in the secondary. The offense continues to creep along under redshirt freshman QB Jameel Sewell, though the running game has shown signs of life the past two weeks. The receiving corps has been a disappointment, with several drops last week, and Virginia has been unable to get the TEs involved downfield, as hoped. Favorite: Maryland by 3-1/2 S. Florida at North Carolina When: Noon Where: Kenan Stadium; Chapel Hill, N.C. Records: South Florida 4-2, North Carolina 1-4. Outlook: Is it hoops season yet? The Tar Heels have been outscored 79-14 in their past two outings and are allowing 35 points per game on the season. They've yet to beat a Division I-A team. South Florida has a stingy defense that allows 16.3 points per game. The Bulls are no offensive power but everyone has moved the ball on North Carolina. Favorite: South Florida by 3-1/2 Fla. International at Miami When: 7 p.m. Where: Orange Bowl, Miami Records: Florida Int. 0-6, Miami 3-2. Outlook: FIU is not nearly as bad as its record. The Panthers have lost five games by a combined 14 points. They rank 32nd in the nation in total defense. Still, this is Miami we're talking about, not North Texas, Bowling Green or Middle Tennessee, some of FIU's other opponents this year. The Hurricanes are in the midst of a soft portion of their schedule, with Duke next week, and are using these games to tune up for a late-reason run. Favorite: Miami by 26 No. 24 Rutgers at Navy When: 1:30 p.m. Where: Navy Memorial Stadium; Annapolis, Md. Records: Rutgers 5-0; Navy 5-1. Radio: 1490 AM About Rutgers: The Scarlet Knights are off to their best start in 30 years, when they went 11-0 in 1976. TB Ray Rice is \"The Man\" for Rutgers, having rushed for 806 yards and 11 TDs. Rutgers had last week off to prepare for this one. Louisville and West Virginia still await Rutgers on the schedule. About Navy: OK, since the Middies haven't beaten Notre Dame since before the Vietnam War, nobody is counting on them to beat Notre Dame this season either. That means that Rutgers is the biggest winnable game on Navy's schedule, and the Scarlet Knights have to come to Annapolis. QB Brian Hampton, in typical option quarterback fashion, has run for 645 yards and 10 TDs at the midway point of the campaign. And the Middies are a failed extra point in overtime against Tulsa from being unbeaten. Favorite: Navy by 2-1/2 Tulsa at East Carolina When: 3 p.m. Where: Dowdy-Ficklen Stadium; Greenville, N.C. Records: Tulsa 4-1, 1-0 Conference USA; ECU 2-3, 1-1. Radio: 1010 AM Outlook: Tulsa junior QB Paul Smith is having a good year, with nine TD passes and three INTs. The Golden Hurricane has won three straight, its lone loss coming at Brigham Young. The Pirates are coming off a 31-21 victory over Virginia and are 2-1 during an unusual string of five straight home games. Senior QB James Pinckney has come into his own: In five games, Pinckney's 224 yards passing against Virginia was his season low. Favorite: Tulsa by 2 JMU at New Hampshire When: Noon Where: Cowell Stadium; Durham, N.H. Records: JMU 4-1, 2-0 Atlantic 10; New Hampshire 5-0, 2-0. Radio: 1310 AM Outlook: The Dukes go to New Hampshire as the 13th-ranked team in I-AA, but they're playing the division's top-ranked team. The winner has an inside track on the Atlantic 10 championship. New Hampshire was finally held under 30 points last week in a 27-17 victory against Richmond. JMU's Justin Rascati has more wins (24) than any QB in school history. New Hampshire wide receiver David Ball broke Jerry Rice's NCAA record for TD receptions last week, hauling in the 51st of his career with more than half his senior season still remaining. William and Mary at Liberty When: 1 p.m. Where: Williams Stadium, Lynchburg Records: W&M 1-4; Liberty 3-2. Radio: 92.3 FM Outlook: The Atlantic 10-member Tribe is 6-0 all time against Big South opponents. But the Tribe is also coming off back-to-back losses, including a 48-7 defeat at UMass. It's Liberty's homecoming game. Richmond at Rhode Island When: Noon Where: Meade Stadium; Kingston, R.I. Records: Richmond 4-1, 1-1 Atlantic 10; Rhode Island 2-3, 0-2. Radio: 950 AM Outlook: The Spiders must travel north for a second consecutive week after losing last week to top-ranked New Hampshire 27-17. Turnovers doomed Richmond last week as they coughed it up three times after leading 14-6 at the half. Coastal Carolina at VMI When: 1 p.m. Where: Foster Stadium, Lexington. Records: Coastal Carolina 4-2, 0-0 Big South; VMI 1-5, 0-0. Radio: 1450 AM Outlook: Coastal Carolina rallied for a thrilling 29-27 victory over No. 3 Furman last week. Coastal QB Tyler Thigpen, who picked apart VMI last season, is coming off a big game against Furman in which he threw for 274 yards. CNU at Maryville When: 1:30 p.m. Where: Thornton Stadium; Maryville, Tenn. Records: CNU 4-1, 2-0 USA South; Maryville 3-3, 2-1. Radio: 99.1 FM Outlook: Justin Long was the USA South defensive Player of the Week after an interception, a fumble recovery which he also caused, and eight tackles in a 28-0 victory over Greensboro. Maryville won 20-14 at Ferrum last week.",
