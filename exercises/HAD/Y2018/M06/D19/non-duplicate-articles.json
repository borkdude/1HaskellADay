The 51-year-old singer/actress/new mom can flawlessly transition from cherub-faced girl next door to sex siren to sizzling dance queen. Helping her convey these many personas is Rob rt Behar, Jackson s chief stylist and costume designer for more than a decade. His job is to make sure that all details of the garment work and move and have a purpose, he said in a phone interview from California. There is nothing done frivolously; everything is in the right spot at the right time. Hampton Roads concertgoers will get a chance to see how art, science and mood come together in the costuming for the State of the World tour tonight at Scope in Norfolk. In his arresting French accent, Behar discussed what it is like working with a down-to-earth icon, and what it takes to make her feel at ease in a constant dance routine. Here are excerpts. Q. Walk us from conceptualization to actualization when it comes to a tour, and how this differs from prepping Janet for red carpet appearances. A. A red carpet appearance is just one moment. It s a matter of making Janet, Janet for that moment. A tour is a whole different thing because a tour is manufacturing her inspiration, manufacturing her visual, her view of what the tour is about. When we work on a tour, we always start conversations with images, references, collecting some months before. Janet always makes you feel welcome, feel comfortable to express yourself. She is absolutely fantastic that way. She also is the creator of all the things. I m able to be in (the process of) sketching and design, but I listen to her. It is a fantastic and unique collaboration. Q. How is the costuming meant to reflect the mood of State of the World ? A. Janet represents a very powerful human being, a strong woman, but at the same time a certain softness. Normally we d go into a futuristic approach to the costumes. At this point in time we went for a more approachable and a more street (take), but still remaining in futuristic ways. That s the expression of the state of the world slightly dark, slightly light, too, because we use a lot of white. It s a mix of the world and all its beauty. Q. Janet is no stranger to touring and the importance of image. What things are you two doing differently now than, say, for the more pared-down feel of the last tour, Up and Close and Personal, in 2011? How are you pushing her to evolve? A. (Chuckles) We don t push Janet to evolve. Janet constantly evolves. This is what I always say to her, Thank you for allowing me to be a better me. She always has pushed me to further the look, to strengthen the image, and stuff like that. When it comes to creating, we have to remember that her tour is almost a straight hour and a half of dancing. We have to work around that; we have to work around finding exceptional fabrics that also are appropriate and help her throughout the show to be able to dance 90 minutes long. So we evolved with the fabrics. We re always looking for stretch fabrics that allow her to bring her arm all the way up and bring it down, and the garment doesn t look crazy, or for her to go down and do the move to the floor, come up and still look intact. I m always in search of new and improved material. For example, the one that we have right now on tour is a bond and stretch, and it s matte it doesn t shine; it has an elegance to it. Janet is an incredibly elegant woman. We want to keep that in mind and also being able to dance. . So it s sort of a puzzle to allow her to be active, but still look on point. Q. I m guessing there are multiples of costumes? A. Absolutely. . Multiples of costumes for her, multiples of costumers for the dancers. There is always enough in case there is an accident. Listen, they dance. I have never seen people dance that hard, you know. The clothes have to be unbreakable. But that is not the reality of things, so there is a backup. Q. Are you present at every tour stop? A. No. We create the wardrobe. I do a few runs with her and then halfway through I ll do another couple more, just to make sure that everything is on point all the time. Q. How would the woman who is not a superstar channel Janet s effervescence when it comes to style? A. (He interrupts the question, laughing.) She s got to be born with it! She s got to be born with it! What reflects Janet is individuality, and when a woman is an individual not driven by outside sources, is doing her own thing, that s when the magic happens the grace and the elegance and the charisma comes. Because that makes you unique."},

The growing medical device manufacturer that\u0019s focused on improving patient safety in infusion therapy and vascular access, will relocate by the end of the year from its Hampton and Williamsburg facilities into Building One. Jeff Johnson, director of Tech Center Research Park, said it is anticipated the first of the 11 buildings will be completed by this fall and the other buildings may take up to 10 years to build out. Johnson said ivWatch is exactly the kind of business they were looking to bring to the park. It\u0019s really about innovation and ivWatch embodies that vision, Johnson said. ivWatch can inspire the discovery that I know is in Hampton Roads and beyond & just below the surface is a ton of discovery waiting to meet the world. ivWatch CEO Gary Warren said the move will increase operational efficiency by combining all departments under one roof. We had expanded into the Hampton facility to do our manufacturing, operation, sales, research and development, but we quickly outgrew that space, Warren said. Research and development is back in Williamsburg and the IV monitors are manufactured in Hampton. The company also uses manufacturers in Wisconsin and Florida. Our goal was to consolidate under one roof, Warren said. You lose a lot of synergy if you don\u0019t have engineers and manufacturers under one roof. Warren said they will now have a state-of-the-art medical device manufacturing and design center in Building One. The Tech Center is very unique. There are a lot of amenities there that are hard to replicate in the region, he said. Also, he said, the new location is ideal for any employees who might live in Venture Apartments which are right across the street. It\u0019s a really innovative district that has probably the first smart community in the state of Virginia, Johnson said noting there is the presence of the national accelerator, access to fast internet and technology, access to talent and flexible office and lab usage. ivWatch, which started in 2010, has doubled its number of employees, to 41, within the last year. Warren said the company expects to grow to around 200 employees in the next four years. About 70 to 80 of those jobs will be high-tech manufacturing positions and marketing sales. Warren said construction is well under way with the building\u0019s steel up, floors laid and roof in place. Plans are to deploy some of the new manufacturing equipment to Tech Center between October and December as the company moves out of its current facilities. ivWatch\u0019s signage will be displayed prominently on the exterior of the building. The company, which maintains an open floor plan concept, will occupy more than 25,500 square feet for manufacturing and warehouse space on the first floor and office space on the first and third floor for operations and research and development. The remainder of the three-story building, which totals 80,000 square feet, will feature other tenants, co-working spaces and a business accelerator program. The key linkage here is to create a community, Jeff Johnson said. We\u0019re not an office park, we\u0019re more of an innovation district and a smart community. At the intersection of Jefferson Avenue and Hogan Drive, the park is being developed by W.M. Jordan Development Co., Virginia Tech and the city of Newport News. The $450 million park has nearly 1 million square feet of space with 11 planned buildings on around 50 acres, 288 residential units and restaurants, shops, fitness clubs, biking trails and gathering spots. Building a medical device company is one of the hardest things I\u0019ve ever done, Warren said. The people who work at ivWatch are very committed and the company is executing very well."},

Research and development is back in Williamsburg and the IV monitors are manufactured in Hampton. The company also uses manufacturers in Wisconsin and Florida. Our goal was to consolidate under one roof, Warren said. You lose a lot of synergy if you don t have engineers and manufacturers under one roof. Warren said they will now have a state-of-the-art medical device manufacturing and design center in Building One. The Tech Center is very unique. There are a lot of amenities there that are hard to replicate in the region, he said. Also, he said, the new location is ideal for any employees who might live in Venture Apartments which are right across the street. It s a really innovative district that has probably the first smart community in the state of Virginia, Johnson said noting there is the presence of the national accelerator, access to fast internet and technology, access to talent and flexible office and lab usage. ivWatch, which started in 2010, has doubled its number of employees, to 41, within the last year. Warren said the company expects to grow to around 200 employees in the next four years. About 70 to 80 of those jobs will be high-tech manufacturing positions and marketing sales. Warren said construction is well under way with the building s steel up, floors laid and roof in place. Plans are to deploy some of the new manufacturing equipment to Tech Center between October and December as the company moves out of its current facilities. ivWatch s signage will be displayed prominently on the exterior of the building. The company, which maintains an open floor plan concept, will occupy more than 25,500 square feet for manufacturing and warehouse space on the first floor and office space on the first and third floor for operations and research and development. The remainder of the three-story building, which totals 80,000 square feet, will feature other tenants, co-working spaces and a business accelerator program. The key linkage here is to create a community, Jeff Johnson said. We re not an office park, we re more of an innovation district and a smart community. At the intersection of Jefferson Avenue and Hogan Drive, the park is being developed by W.M. Jordan Development Co., Virginia Tech and the city of Newport News. The $450 million park has nearly 1 million square feet of space with 11 planned buildings on around 50 acres, 288 residential units and restaurants, shops, fitness clubs, biking trails and gathering spots. Building a medical device company is one of the hardest things I ve ever done, Warren said. The people who work at ivWatch are very committed and the company is executing very well."},
