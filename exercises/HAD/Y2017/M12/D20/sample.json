It's cylindrical, dark and reddish, a quarter-mile long. The object won't be staying. This fall, astronomers announced that the thing came blazing into our neck of the galaxy at speeds of up to 196,000 mph. It is now headed away as quickly as it came.<\/p>","<p>The object's trajectory is so strange and its speeds are so blistering that it probably did not originate from within our solar system. Its discoverers concluded that the object is a rare interstellar traveler from beyond our solar system, the first object of its kind observed by humans.<\/p>","<p>Astronomers at the University of Hawaii, who discovered the object with the Pan-STARRS 1 telescope, said the visitor was an asteroid. In October, they named the asteroid 'Oumuamua - Hawaiian for \"messenger.\" 'Oumuamua, which appears rocky or metallic, lacks the characteristics of a comet.<\/p>","<p>Some scientists, though they are swift to say 'Oumuamua is probably natural, have not yet ruled out more extraordinary origins. \"The possibility that this object is, in fact, an artificial object - that it is a spaceship, essentially - is a remote possibility,\" Andrew Siemion, director of the Berkeley Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence Research Center, told The Washington Post on Monday.<\/p>","<p>Siemion is a member of the Breakthrough Listen initiative: a $100 million project, backed by Russian billionaire Yuri Milner, to hunt for extraterrestrial intelligence. This week, researchers with the Breakthrough Listen initiative announced that a radio telescope will probe 'Oumuamua for signs of technology. The telescope, nestled within the hills of the Green Bank Observatory in West Virginia, begins its search on Wednesday.<\/p>","<p>'Oumuamua behaves oddly. Planets and asteroids circle the sun on the same plane, like water swirling around a basin. 'Oumuamua dipped into the solar system from outside the plane, as if leaked from a cosmic faucet.<\/p>","<p>It is shaped strangely, too. Most asteroids of this size are spherical. This object has the proportions of a giant cucumber. In fact, Harvard University astronomer Avi Loeb recently told Milner that 'Oumuamua has the optimal design of a vessel meant to travel through space, the Atlantic reported.<\/p>","<p>Yet all of its features are \"entirely consistent with being a natural object,\" said Karen Meech, the University of Hawaii astronomer who led the research team to measure 'Oumuamua's physical properties. \"That being said, we cannot disprove the unlikely hypothesis that it is not.\"<\/p>","<p>Astronomers across the planet have turned their sensors at the object. The European Southern Observatory followed up on the initial Hawaiian detection from Chile, peering at 'Oumuamua through the Very Large Telescope in Chile.<\/p>","<p>Though the most likely explanation for 'Oumuamua is that it's lifeless rock, scientists aren't about to let it breeze by without scrutiny. That's why they are using Green Bank. Over the past 18 months, SETI astronomers have installed detectors at the telescope to look for signs of electromagnetic activity in space.

If passed, the amendment would direct that offenders could be deemed ineligible for parole under the three-strikes law only if they were out of prison between each of their three convictions.<\/p>","<p>\u201cThis three-strikes rule is a hangover from the so-called tough-on-crime policies of the \u201980s and \u201990s that overcriminalized, overpunished, and swept up people who we never intended to punish so harshly,\u201d said Surovell, who was elected to the Senate in November 2015. \u201cHopefully, we can focus our most severe punishments on criminals who have a shown a history of violence and who have proven incapable of rehabilitation.\u201d<\/p>","<p>The 1982 law that he\u2019s seeking to amend allowed offenders to be deemed parole-ineligible even if they had never been to prison before and their three crimes were committed in a single spree.

Most of the 41 three-strikers interviewed by The Pilot had committed robberies.<\/p>","<p>Days after that article\u2019s publication, Surovell said in a phone interview with The Pilot that he would submit legislation to change the law.<\/p>","<p>Surovell\u2019s amendment would affect the men \u2013 and at least one woman \u2013 who are still incarcerated for crimes committed between 1982 and 1995, when the state abolished parole and rendered the three-strikes law moot.<\/p>","<p>A new three-strikes law has targeted recidivists and only punished those who were \u201cat liberty\u201d \u2013 in other words, not locked up \u2013 between their convictions. But it didn\u2019t help the three-strikers who lost their parole eligibility under the previous law.<\/p>","<p>That\u2019s what Surovell\u2019s amendment would address.<\/p>","<p>As many as 260 three-strikers from the 1982 law are in Virginia prisons now. And almost none of the inmates interviewed for The Pilot\u2019s report were at liberty between each of their three offenses. Most have served prison terms longer than the typical first-degree murder convict in Virginia \u2013 and have years to go before they\u2019re released, The Pilot reported.<\/p>","<p>Surovell\u2019s proposed legislation states that three-strikers would be eligible for parole \u201cunless that person was at liberty between the three convictions\u201d and used a weapon during the crimes.<\/p>","<p>\u201cFrom my perspective, it\u2019s what the original three-strikes law was meant to be,\u201d said defense attorney Evan Werbel, who represented one three-striker in recent years. \u201cIn my mind, it\u2019s a good thing.\u201d<\/p>","<p>The proposed legislation appears to have support among conservative lawmakers, too. Republican Del. Chris Jones of Suffolk previously said that he generally would support such a bill.<\/p>","<p>On Tuesday evening, Republican Sen. Frank Wagner of Virginia Beach said he\u2019d support that legislation as it pertains to robbers. But he said he wouldn\u2019t be comfortable letting out three-strikers who are murderers or child rapists. And he would want a steep penalty included for any three-strikers who got released and committed another crime.<\/p>","<p>\u201cFor some of those, the robberies and those kinds of things, I\u2019d be very much open to it,\u201d Wagner said. \u201cDefinitely with those caveats, I\u2019d be supportive of it.\u201d<\/p>"]},{"uuid":"af676c59-11e8-521d-a1c4-daf99503a98f","title":"Want to watch Ralph Northam get sworn in as governor?

went so late in drafts and was a backup on most fantasy teams to start the season, hopefully most of his owners have another viable quarterback to fall back to. This is the reason fantasy players should always work the waiver wire to build depth at each position. It's come to a point in the NFL where it's not a matter of if any of your star players will suffer injuries, but when and how many.<\/p>","<p>If you end the season with the same lineup you started with, consider it a minor miracle in today's NFL.<\/p>","<p>For the Wentz owners who have a shaky backup, the waiver wire is likely your only option\u00a0\u2013 unless you're in a custom league that allows trades until the end of the season. Even if they have a decent backup, they should consider replacing Wentz with a new backup.<\/p>","<p>The first name to check on is Green Bay's Aaron Rodgers, who is eligible to return from injured reserve this weekend. No official announcement has been made yet on whether he's been cleared by doctors, but he did return to practice last week and reportedly looked good.<\/p>","<p>Believe it or not, Rodgers is still available in 36 percent of ESPN leagues. In Yahoo leagues, he's out there in 18 percent.<\/p>","<p>If Rodgers is not available, the drop-off in talent is not surprisingly significant. Wentz's replacement, Nick Foles, is an option along with Jacksonville's Blake Bortles, San Francisco's Jimmy Garoppolo and Baltimore's Joe Flacco among others.<\/p>","<p>Foles has averaged 15.5 fantasy points a game in his 32 career contests with the Eagles, an average that would rank him 18th among QBs this season. So in that sense, he's not an ideal QB1. The factor that boosts his value in Week 15 is his match-up against the New York Giants on Sunday. The Giants have allowed the most fantasy points to opposing QBs (19.5) and rank 31st against the pass, allowing 265.7 yards a game.<\/p>","<p>Bortles has been one of the better fantasy QBs in the past three weeks, averaging 22.0 points in that span. The addition and emergence of wide receiver Dede Westbrook has something to do with that. More on Westbrook later. Bortles also has a favorable match-up against Houston at home. The Texans rank 26th against the pass and allow the fourth-most QB points.<\/p>","<p>Garoppolo has thrown for 627 yards combined in his past two games and has a good match-up against Tennessee at home. The Titans rank 22nd in pass defense.<\/p>","<p>Flacco is averaging 17.7 fantasy points in his past two games and plays at Cleveland, which ranks 21st against the pass.<\/p>","<p>Here's a rundown of quarterback possibilities:<\/p>","<table border=\"1\"><tbody><tr><td><strong>\u00a0Quarterbacks\u00a0\u00a0<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>\u00a0Team\u00a0\u00a0<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>\u00a0Noteworthy\u00a0\u00a0<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>\u00a0ESPN\u00a0\u00a0<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>\u00a0Yahoo\u00a0\u00a0<\/strong><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>\u00a0Aaron Rodgers\u00a0<\/td><td>\u00a0GB<\/td><td>\u00a0Obvious choice if he's available &amp; cleared to play\u00a0<\/td><td>\u00a036%<\/td><td>\u00a018%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>\u00a0Blake Bortles<\/td><td>\u00a0JAC<\/td><td>\u00a02 TD passes in 2 straight games for 1st time all season\u00a0<\/td><td>\u00a080%<\/td><td>\u00a064%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>\u00a0Nick Foles<\/td><td>\u00a0PHI<\/td><td>\u00a0Has a great match-up and a good offense around him<\/td><td>\u00a099%<\/td><td>\u00a096%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>\u00a0Jimmy Garoppolo\u00a0<\/td><td>\u00a0SF<\/td><td>\u00a0Averaging 313 passing yards in first two starts with SF<\/td><td>\u00a077%<\/td><td>\u00a079%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>\u00a0Joe Flacco<\/td><td>\u00a0BAL<\/td><td>\u00a0Has thrown for 269 yards, 2 TDs each of past 2 games\u00a0<\/td><td>\u00a094%<\/td><td>\u00a086%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>\u00a0Jameis Winston<\/td><td>\u00a0TB<\/td><td>\u00a0Puts up numbers, but has TO problem, tough match-up<\/td><td>\u00a039%<\/td><td>\u00a045%<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table>","<p>\u00a0 \u00a0<\/p>","<p>The best non-quarterback options to me would be wide receivers Dede Westbrook of Jacksonville and Marquise Goodwin of San Francisco.

Kim, the acting U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, said at a news conference discussing the charges Tuesday.<\/p>","<p>The 10-page criminal complaint also reveals some of what Ullah told investigators after the attack. While he was in Bellevue Hospital receiving treatment for his injuries, Ullah declared he acted on behalf of the Islamic State, and investigators found a passport in his name with handwritten notations, including: \"O AMERICA, DIE IN YOUR RAGE,'' according to the complaint.<\/p>","<p>Those statements are just a fraction of the incriminating comments Ullah has made to investigators, according to law enforcement officials.<\/p>","<p>Ullah, who remains hospitalized, told police he was angry about decades of U.S. policies toward Muslim countries, officials said. Investigators believe Ullah built the bomb at his home and used Christmas lights and a battery to detonate the device, according to the complaint.<\/p>","<p>On Monday morning, Ullah was on his way to carry out the attack when he opened Facebook and posted a message for the president, federal authorities alleged. \"Trump you failed to protect your nation,\" Ullah wrote, according to the complaint. Kim declined to elaborate on whether there was anything specific the president had said or done that Ullah found objectionable. Ullah also posted a statement on Facebook aimed at telling other Islamic State supporters that he was carrying out the attack in the group's name, the complaint continued.<\/p>","<p>Shortly before the federal charges were announced, New York City police officials said they had filed state terrorism charges against him, though those are expected to be dropped once the federal prosecution gets underway, according to officials.<\/p>","<p>Ullah is an immigrant from Bangladesh who came to the United States in 2011. According to the complaint filed Tuesday, Ullah's radicalization began in at least 2014, as he viewed Islamic State propaganda online. Among the materials was a video urging followers to carry out attacks close to home if they were unable to travel overseas, the complaint stated.<\/p>","<p>When his homemade bomb exploded Monday, it did far more damage to the would-be suicide bomber than anyone else in the station, according to officials. Three commuters suffered minor injuries, police said. Security video from the subway tunnel shows a man walking down the passageway who is suddenly knocked to the ground by a blast emanating from his lower torso. The video shows other commuters running from the scene.<\/p>","<p>Ullah's family issued a statement saying they are \"heartbroken by this attack on our city today,\" but also criticizing law enforcement's treatment of the family.<\/p>","<p>\"Today we have seen our children, as young as 4 years old, held out in the cold, detained as their parents were questioned,\" the family said in its statement, which was released through the Council on American-Islamic Relations of New York. \"One teenage relative was pulled out of high school classes and interrogated without a lawyer, without his parents. These are not the actions that we expect from our judicial system.\"<\/p>","<p>Officials said Ullah came to the United States on a type of visa for relatives of people already living legally in the country. Trump said the incident was another example of why the United States needs to curb immigration.<\/p>","<p>\"Today's attempted mass murder attack in New York City - the second terrorist attack in New York in the last two months - once again highlights the urgent need for Congress to enact legislative reforms to protect the American people,\" the president said in a statement released Monday. \" . . . America must fix its lax immigration system, which allows far too many dangerous, inadequately vetted people to access our country. Today's terror suspect entered our country through extended-family chain migration, which is incompatible with national security.\"<\/p>","<p>He also said that people convicted of terrorism charges \"deserve the strongest penalty allowed by law, including the death penalty in appropriate cases.\"<\/p>","<p>Speaking Tuesday at an event in Baltimore, Attorney General Jeff Sessions blamed Monday's incident on \"failed immigration policies\" such as the Diversity Visa Lottery.<\/p>","<p>\"An immigrant in Bangladesh won the lottery,\" he said. \"He brought his sister. She brought her son, who was 20 years old. He attempted to blow up the subway.\"<\/p>","<p>Sessions also said more than 100,000 refugees entered the United States under the Obama administration and that many of them were from the \"same region\" as the attacker. \"This overwhelms the ability of the FBI to monitor them,\" he said. \"It's a myth that we have the power and the unlimited resources to surveil hundreds of thousands of people.\"<\/p>","<p>\"It's physically impossible to stop all attacks,\" Sessions added. \"So we need to make sure we're reducing stress on [the FBI] by vetting people carefully.\"<\/p>","<p>New York officials said the city was lucky that the suspect was not a better bomb-maker.<\/p>","<p>Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, D, called the attacker's weapon a \"low-tech device,\" saying: \"Anyone can go on the Internet and download garbage and vileness and how to put together an amateur-level explosive device, and that is the reality that we live with. The counter-reality is that this is New York and we all pitch together and we are a savvy people.\"<\/p>","<p>John Miller, who leads the New York Police Department's counterterrorism work, said terrorism threats are \"a fact of life, whether you're in New York or London or Paris.

After she said in November that former president Bill Clinton should have resigned the presidency following his inappropriate affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky, longtime Hillary Clinton adviser and confidant Philippe Reines excoriated her on Twitter for being ungrateful and two-faced.<\/p>","<p>\"Ken Starr spent $70 million on a consensual (sex act),\" Reines wrote. \"Senate voted to keep POTUS WJC.

The downtown space will feature a tasting room, food service and a three-and-a-half-barrel brewing system.<\/p>","<p>The name, Goodwater, emphasizes the attention to sustainability that the brewery has embraced from its inception. The name also highlights the primary philanthropic focus of the brewery: improving clean water access for Nine Mile, Jamaica, the community that Bob Marley called home.<\/p>","<p>Lisa Pumphrey visited Nine Mile after a cousin introduced her to Richard Booker. She was moved by the challenges the villagers faced getting water. She describes children filling containers with water at a village faucet and then carrying them back to their homes \u2014 or begging for money to buy water when the catchment tank runs low.<\/p>","<p>Richard Booker brings more to the partnership than just a connection to fame. As a restaurateur and businessman, he operates three Mama Marley\u2019s restaurants. He\u2019ll use his trained palate and experience to create new recipes for Goodwater beer and to support kitchen operations at the new tasting room.<\/p>","<p>\u201cHe\u2019s a big foodie,\u201d says Pumphrey, \u201cso it\u2019s been really fun getting him into beer. \u2026 All the different malts, all the different hops, all the different ingredients, the complexities, the different yeasts \u2014 he\u2019s so excited.\u201d<\/p>","<p>The first beer that Lickinghole and Marley have created, 9 Mile Goodwater IPA, is branded with a regal lion and Jamaican colors set against a map of the island. Partial proceeds from the beer will help to provide improved clean water access, including wells and pipes, to the Nine Mile community.<\/p>","<p>The Shockoe Bottom tasting room will include a downstairs bar with eight taps and community tables, loft seating and televisions. The basement will house the brewing system, barrels for aging and a small room for events.<\/p>","<p>\u201cI know it\u2019s vibrant down here [in Shockoe Bottom] at night,\u201d Stockton says. \u201cI feel like we\u2019ll be the nine-to-midnight crowd, and not the midnight-to-two crowd.\u201d<\/p>","<p>Since both locations are part of the same business, both can serve all of Lickinghole beers. This will enable the Shockoe Bottom Goodwater bar to keep its lines flowing while allowing the brewers to make a variety of experimental beers. Pumphrey anticipates bringing a small system over from Goochland so it can begin brewing before the full system is in. She also expects that brewers will shift between the locations to exercise their creativity with the small-batch beers.<\/p>","<p>Two other new Lickinghole core beers also come with a \u201cphilanthropic twist,\u201d Pumphrey says, \u201cwhich I need to keep me motivated.\u201d Scarlet Honey is a hoppy red ale using estate honey, with proceeds targeted to purchase more apiaries \u2014 first at the farm and then elsewhere. And Maiden\u2019s Blonde will help promote James River cleanup.<\/p>","<p>Besides 9 Mile Goodwater IPA, Pumphrey plans to release a 9 Mile Goodwater Stout using Jamaican Blue Mountain coffee and scotch bonnet peppers, for distribution here and in Jamaica.<\/p>","<p>In the future, Pumphrey hopes to open a brewery in Jamaica. In addition to brewing beer for the marketplace, it could provide training and employment for locals.<\/p>"]},{"uuid":"905a8c8c-cba9-5ec1-b16e-4d8f4b412070","title":"A historic Virginia Beach house isn't being destroyed.

Whatever decision Virginia Beach makes may not be the best for Norfolk,\u201d he said. \u201cBut when it comes to common things like transportation and education and those important things, we all should be finding a lot more common ground.\u201d<\/p>","<p>Joseph said projects such as light rail, which was voted down in Virginia Beach in 2016, should be used to increase connectivity between the area\u2019s cities.<\/p>","<p>\u201cThat was a very important piece of us trying to establish a form of mass transit in Hampton Roads,\u201d he said. \u201cAgain, it was just kind of disappointing that it didn\u2019t come to fruition.\u201d<\/p>","<p>William Harrell, president and CEO of Hampton Roads Transit, said he was also disappointed the light rail was rejected by voters. It would have helped handle future traffic congestion, he said.<\/p>","<p>\u201cWe are a region of 1.7 million projected to grow by 2040 (in population). You certainly want to be in a position where you want to expand transit and put the infrastructure in place before that growth \u2026\u201d he said. \u201cCertainly, we were disappointed in Virginia Beach not deciding to extend light rail. After that decision, we decided to expand on the bus system.\u201d<\/p>","<p>Virginia Beach Councilwoman Shannon Kane said increased entrepreneurial incentives and collaboration between small businesses and universities could also steer Hampton Roads into the direction of Nashville\u2019s success.<\/p>","<p>\u201cI was really excited to see the small business community and universities and how they all work together to groom and cultivate the next generation of business owners. I think they do a really good job of wrapping their arms around that and I would like to see us do more of that \u2026\u201d she said. \u201cI think we have a long way to go but I think we\u2019ve come a long way.\u201d<\/p>","<p>Robert Crum, executive director of the Hampton Roads Planning District Commission, said Nashville had really identified its strengths and worked on its branding as the world\u2019s hub of country music.<\/p>","<p>And Hampton Roads has plenty of assets to choose from for regional branding, he said.<\/p>","<p>\u201cYou know, perhaps we don\u2019t tell our story as effectively as they (Nashville) do...

To make it clear that God would not lead anybody toward sin, the pope suggested a better translation of the Greek prayer from the New Testament would be something along the lines of, \"Do not let us fall into temptation.\"<\/p><p>Any change to the text of the Mass in the Catholic Church takes lengthy deliberations. Francis' comments won't lead to a change in what churchgoers recite this Sunday.<\/p><p>But there's precedent for the sort of change he suggested: The Catholic Church in France switched its liturgy on Sunday from \"Ne nous soumets pas \u00e0 la tentation\" (roughly \"Don't expose us to temptation\") to an updated version, \"Ne nous laisse pas entrer en tentation\" (meaning \"Don't let us enter into temptation.\")<\/p><p>Christians who have been taught the Lord's Prayer, also known as the Our Father prayer, from the time they were children reacted with surprise to the news of the pope's comments. On social media, many reacted with comments such as, \"Leave the Lord's Prayer alone!\"<\/p><p>The prayer comes from the book of Matthew, in which Jesus teaches his followers, \"This, then, is how you should pray,\" then recites the now-famous words.<\/p><p>Francis spoke about the prayer in an interview with Marco Pozza, a prison chaplain in Padua, on the channel TV2000 that is owned by Italian bishops. Pozza said that people sometimes ask him, \"Father Marco, how can God ever lead us into temptation?\"<\/p><p>The pope replied that the translation is \"not good.\"<\/p><p>\"It's not about letting me fall into temptation. It's I, the one who falls, not Him pushing me toward temptation,\" Francis said, miming the gesture of pushing someone, \"so as to then see how I fall. No, well, a father won't do that. A father will immediately help you pick yourself up. Satan's the one leading you into temptation. That's Satan's task.\"<\/p><p>Michael Dauphinais, the chair of the theology department at Ave Maria University, said he has discussed the same confusion with his students about the meaning of this key prayer. \"It's certainly important to understand that God is not ever going to lead us into temptation, that our Lord permits evils and sufferings to occur, but he does not ever lead us into sin,\" he said.<\/p><p>He said Pope Francis is \"a good pastor\" to have realized that his flock may be misunderstanding the words.<\/p><p>\"The only thing that can separate us from God is our own sins, and never his action. The traditional language, when it says, 'Lead us not into temptation,' the alternative that God will lead us to sin: It can't mean that, or else the rest of the prayer, and the rest of the Christian faith, wouldn't make sense,\" Dauphinais said. \"That's what the pope is trying to exclude. He's trying to exclude a possible misunderstanding of that expression. When we say, 'Lead us not into temptation,' it's just a trust, that we are under the care of a loving father; there are no accidents.\"<\/p><\/div><\/div>"]},{"uuid":"44c8e167-3865-5e9b-a73d-602836219601","title":"Jay Gruden taking all the blame for Redskins' woes sounds familiar","type":"article","presentation":null,"url":"http:\/\/pilotonline.com\/sports\/football\/professional\/washington\/jay-gruden-taking-all-the-blame-for-redskins-woes-sounds\/article_44c8e167-3865-5e9b-a73d-602836219601.html","lastupdated":{"utc":"1513119408000","iso8601":"2017-12-12T17:56:48-05:00","rfc2822":"Tue, 12 Dec 2017 17:56:48 -0500"},"starttime":{"utc":"1513093740000","iso8601":"2017-12-12T10:49:00-05:00","rfc2822":"Tue, 12 Dec 2017 10:49:00 -0500"},"archivetime":{"uts":null,"iso8601":null,"rfc2822":null},"keywords":["#posports4"],"sections":["sports\/football\/professional\/washington"],"flags":["wire"],"thumbnail":{"mode":"via .view","uuid":"44c8e167-3865-5e9b-a73d-602836219601","aspect_ratio":"100:77","aspect_ratio_x":100,"aspect_ratio_y":77,"file_size":352500,"height":77,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","url":"https:\/\/bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com\/pilotonline.com\/content\/tncms\/assets\/v3\/editorial\/5\/38\/538742e3-dce1-5d88-ba70-62fa92ca61e1\/5a3047b7cadad.image.jpg?resize=100%2C77","resource_url":"https:\/\/bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com\/pilotonline.com\/content\/tncms\/assets\/v3\/editorial\/5\/38\/538742e3-dce1-5d88-ba70-62fa92ca61e1\/5a3047b7cadad.image.jpg?resize=100%2C77","width":100},"preview":{"mode":"via .view","uuid":"44c8e167-3865-5e9b-a73d-602836219601","aspect_ratio":"160:123","aspect_ratio_x":160,"aspect_ratio_y":123,"file_size":352500,"height":492,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","url":"https:\/\/bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com\/pilotonline.com\/content\/tncms\/assets\/v3\/editorial\/5\/38\/538742e3-dce1-5d88-ba70-62fa92ca61e1\/5a3047b7cadad.image.jpg?resize=640%2C492","resource_url":"https:\/\/bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com\/pilotonline.com\/content\/tncms\/assets\/v3\/editorial\/5\/38\/538742e3-dce1-5d88-ba70-62fa92ca61e1\/5a3047b7cadad.image.jpg?resize=640%2C492","width":640},"authors":[],"prologue":"<p>Washington's head coach pointing a finger at himself isn't a new development.

I've not gotten this team ready to play. So it's on me.\"<\/p>","<p>Now, Jay Gruden, who said Sunday that he had gone backward, isn't Jim Zorn, who uttered those worst-coach-in-America words in 2008. And really, the situations can't be the same, because when Zorn said what he said after a humiliating loss to the one-win Cincinnati Bengals, Chris Cooley was a Washington tight end and not a Washington radio analyst, Kirk Cousins was a backup quarterback for Michigan State and not the most interesting potential free agent in the NFL, and Gruden was finishing his final season as an offensive assistant in Tampa Bay and not the head coach for a once-proud NFL pillar.<\/p>","<p>The deck chairs have been rearranged. That low-slung strip mall of a headquarters in Ashburn, Virginia is still the same building, but just about every office - save one - has had at least one new occupant since then, some several.<\/p>","<p>Still, bringing up the Zorn era - 2008 to 2009, and man, those were heady times, R.I.P. - still kind of represents, at least viscerally, the low point in modern Washington football history. When people start to talk about how insane it was that Mike Shanahan threw Robert Griffin III back out there in the Seattle playoff game, or that they borderline-slandered the outgoing GM because of substance abuse, just counter with, \"They once hired a bingo caller to be the offensive coordinator with a week's preparation,\" and that usually ends the argument as to which seasons brought the most chaos.<\/p>","<p>So we mention Zorn here not as a direct comparison, but to get your attention. Because even if Washington couldn't get your attention during its dismal 30-13 loss to the Los Angeles Chargers on Sunday - be honest, who didn't switch over to Eagles-Rams at some point in the second half? - Gruden's words are worthy of your time.<\/p>","<p>To start, immediately after the game, facing reporters in Carson, California.<\/p>","<p>\"We have not been competitive, and we weren't ready to play . . . today,\" Gruden said. \"And that's on me and the staff. We have to do a better job of getting these guys ready to play.\"<\/p>","<p>Now, let's not dismiss the admirable elements here. This is a coach playing with an offense that has lost its starting center, one guard, its play-making running back, its best-in-the-league-when-healthy tight end and one key free agent wide receiver. He could put his team's struggles - a cumulative score of 68-27 over the past two weeks, including the loss to the Chargers for which he had 10 days to prepare - on the injuries, and there would be truth in that. He does not hang his players on a clothes line and say, \"See, look what he did wrong.\" He stands there and takes his lumps. Bravo.<\/p>","<p>But we're at a worrisome point now because Gruden pointing his index finger directly at himself isn't a new development. It's beyond a trend, even. It's something of a character trait. Take a listen.<\/p>","<p>\"They just outcoached and outplayed us.\"<\/p>","<p>\"We were flat outcoached, there's no question about that. We weren't as ready as I would have liked to have been. We didn't execute like I would like to have seen. That falls on my shoulders.\"<\/p>","<p>\"I feel like we underachieved today, and that's very frustrating.\"<\/p>","<p>And, when asked whether his team was ready to compete: \"I'd like to think so, but obviously the results say otherwise, so what can you say?\"<\/p>","<p>What can you say? Well, one reasonable response could be: Get better. Fix it. Have you not grown, yourself, as a coach?<\/p>","<p>Each one of these quotes is from last season. In your match-the-words-to-the-game contest, they came, in order, after the season-opening loss to Pittsburgh; a crucial loss to Carolina in December; a loss to Arizona that was part of a 2-4 finish; and, finally, the season-ending 19-10 loss to the New York Giants, when a victory would have put Washington in the playoffs.<\/p>","<p>There is accountability, and the coach should be commended for being forthright. But when thinking about Gruden's current situation - with three games to play in what will be the eighth season in the past 10 without a playoff berth - it's instructive to think back on the chaotic seasons under Zorn.<\/p>","<p>Let's be clear: Vinny Cerrato isn't the general manager, and the current GM doesn't have a radio show on which he can express his vision. (Man, those were the days.)<\/p>","<p>But that day Zorn walked in front of the cameras at Redskins Park and outlined a process in which he would turn the spotlight on himself, he did so because owner Daniel Snyder wanted him to. He needed Zorn to fall on the sword because any other assessment would have meant a more thorough examination of the roster Cerrato and Snyder had assembled - not to mention further wondering why they had hired this guy as head coach in the first place.<\/p>","<p>We can tell ourselves that the structure in Ashburn is more stable now, more normal, and that might be the case. Maybe Scot McCloughan's ouster was really about his personal problems, and maybe Doug Williams is the perfect person to guide the personnel department in evaluation and acquisition. And, given Gruden's penchant for blaming himself - and, therefore admirably taking blame off his players - this doesn't feel like an ownership-ordered edict for public humiliation. It feels like a coach taking the heat, of which there's plenty.<\/p>","<p>But what we have here is the same tired franchise, all these seasons later with more questions than hope.<\/p>","<p>\"To me, it's all about me,\" Zorn said all those years ago.<\/p>","<p>The truth is, it wasn't all about Zorn back then, and it's not all about Gruden now. But those words, the phrases in which the coach blames himself time and again, they can't go unnoticed. They might not represent the whole truth of why this season will end with three meaningless games, and they might not indicate that the franchise is in the complete disarray it once was. But they can't be dismissed either. The head coach is not only responsible for assigning blame to himself when it's due, but he's responsible for fixing it, too, and that hasn't happened.<\/p>"]},{"uuid":"f154cfb7-6206-5e1d-a197-8fe65b4f0b07","title":"With their Lego \u201cMars colony,\u201d Portsmouth students learn to fly drones","type":"article","presentation":null,"url":"http:\/\/pilotonline.com\/news\/local\/education\/public-schools\/with-their-lego-mars-colony-portsmouth-students-learn-to-fly\/article_f154cfb7-6206-5e1d-a197-8fe65b4f0b07.html","lastupdated":{"utc":"1513081607000","iso8601":"2017-12-12T07:26:47-05:00","rfc2822":"Tue, 12 Dec 2017 07:26:47 -0500"},"starttime":{"utc":"1513090800000","iso8601":"2017-12-12T10:00:00-05:00","rfc2822":"Tue, 12 Dec 2017 10:00:00 -0500"},"archivetime":{"uts":null,"iso8601":null,"rfc2822":null},"keywords":["portsmouth public schools","victory elementary school","drones","mission to mars","starbase victory","stem","rich neefe"],"sections":["news\/local\/education\/public-schools"],"flags":[],"thumbnail":{"mode":"via .view","uuid":"f154cfb7-6206-5e1d-a197-8fe65b4f0b07","aspect_ratio":"100:67","aspect_ratio_x":100,"aspect_ratio_y":67,"file_size":350198,"height":67,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","url":"https:\/\/bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com\/pilotonline.com\/content\/tncms\/assets\/v3\/editorial\/b\/32\/b32d1f08-c8be-518f-badf-390349c24c5f\/5a2f116a85292.image.jpg?resize=100%2C67","resource_url":"https:\/\/bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com\/pilotonline.com\/content\/tncms\/assets\/v3\/editorial\/b\/32\/b32d1f08-c8be-518f-badf-390349c24c5f\/5a2f116a85292.image.jpg?resize=100%2C67","width":100},"preview":{"mode":"via .view","uuid":"f154cfb7-6206-5e1d-a197-8fe65b4f0b07","aspect_ratio":"640:429","aspect_ratio_x":640,"aspect_ratio_y":429,"file_size":350198,"height":429,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","url":"https:\/\/bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com\/pilotonline.com\/content\/tncms\/assets\/v3\/editorial\/b\/32\/b32d1f08-c8be-518f-badf-390349c24c5f\/5a2f116a85292.image.jpg?resize=640%2C429","resource_url":"https:\/\/bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com\/pilotonline.com\/content\/tncms\/assets\/v3\/editorial\/b\/32\/b32d1f08-c8be-518f-badf-390349c24c5f\/5a2f116a85292.image.jpg?resize=640%2C429","width":640},"authors":[{"avatar":"https:\/\/pilotonline.com\/pilotonline.com\/content\/tncms\/avatars\/6\/d5\/bb2\/6d5bb27a-6225-11e5-8b6f-10604b9ffe60.3f222289525606e51bb0b0d5111dd5b5.png","byline":null,"first_name":"Matt","last_name":"McKinney","screen_name":"matt mckinney","uuid":"6d5bb27a-6225-11e5-8b6f-10604b9ffe60"}],"prologue":"<p><span data-mce-mark=\"1\">When humans land on the Red Planet, \u201cthese kids might be the ones working on it.\u201d<\/span><\/p>","subheadline":null,"tagline":"<p>Matt McKinney, 757-222-5150, matt.mckinney@pilotonline.com Follow @Mmckinne17 on Twitter.<!--p:Tagline--><\/p>","byline":"By Matt McKinney \n<br>The Virginian-Pilot","hammer":null,"kicker":null,"content":["<h5>PORTSMOUTH<\/h5>","<p>The four of them crowded around the command module, teeth clenched, as they programmed the drone for a supply drop-off on \u201cMars,\u201d one chance left to get it right.<\/p>","<p>\u201cThis is it,\u201d Ashriel Naftali said, as he pressed the go button, sending the drone whizzing upward and toward the famished Martian colony.<\/p>","<p>It worked: mission accomplished.<\/p>","<p>OK, they weren\u2019t actually sending it to Mars.

You think a year is a long time? Think again. Reception venues are booked far in advance.<\/p>","<p>2) Get a band. It\u2019s a huge expense, but it\u2019s also well worth it. Cut corners elsewhere if you have to. A good band really makes the event much more lively and fun.<\/p>","<p>3) The cake isn\u2019t that important. Get a nice cake at a decent price, but keep in mind not everyone will eat cake, so you don\u2019t need a piece per person. I ordered way too much. And guess what? Some of the tiers can be frosted Styrofoam \u2013 and it still looks amazing. None will be the wiser \u2013 except you, for saving a ton of money.<\/p>","<p>4) Invite only the people with whom you feel especially close. Quality, not quantity, is key.<\/p>","<p>5) Be prepared for people to RSVP that they\u2019ll attend and then cancel at the last minute. I think this is really rude unless there\u2019s an emergency. But it will happen. And you\u2019ll not forget who did it.<\/p>","<p>6) Check floral wedding packages at warehouse discount stores. We didn\u2019t do this, because we had a local florist match the prices we found online, but there are some lovely options available.<\/p>","<p>7) Get a great caterer. This is another area where you shouldn\u2019t skimp. Read online reviews and make sure you have a food tasting in advance. Service is equally important to the quality of the food. Our caterer was amazing.<\/p>","<p>8) Make sure the bride and groom click with the photographer. Our photographer established a rapport with our daughter that helped her capture not just images, but \u201cmoments.\u201d<\/p>","<p>9) Keep a notebook by your bed. I woke up nearly every night with an earth-shattering concern. I would jot it down and then not forget it in the morning.<\/p>","<p>10) Wear comfortable shoes!<\/p>","<p>11) Make a tentative budget \u2013 and then double it. That\u2019s what the event will actually cost \u2013 double what you were expecting.<\/p>","<p>12) Have fun and enjoy it! That was my goal.

Richard C. Shelby, R-Ala., who voted for a write-in candidate, said Sunday that he found Moore's accusers to be \"believable\" and that Moore would not represent the state well.<\/p>","<p>\"I think Alabama deserves better,\" Shelby said Sunday on CNN's \"State of the Union.\"<\/p>","<p>Alabama Secretary of State John Merrill said he expects about 25 percent of eligible voters to cast a ballot in the special election, making the race difficult to predict. Three new polls released Monday showed dramatically different results, based on different projections of who would vote.<\/p>","<p>An automated poll from Emerson College showed Moore with a nine-point advantage, while a poll from Fox News showed Jones with a 10-point lead. A Monmouth University Poll showed the race about even.<\/p>","<p>\"I'm hearing everything,\" said Brian Walsh, president of America First Action, an outside group that has spent more than $1.1 million on mail, television and digital ads to support Moore. \"Nobody knows what the hell is going on right now.\"<\/p>","<p>Reports of the robo-calls from Obama and Biden created some awkwardness for Jones, who has tried to project distance from the national party as he closes out his campaign. Although his campaign confirmed the calls, the candidate said he was not aware of them.<\/p>","<p>\"I know that there have been a lot of robo-calls that have been recorded. I don't know what's being used. That is just not something I'm doing,\" Jones said at a campaign stop at a local restaurant, where members of the media outnumbered customers.<\/p>","<p>Giles Perkins, chairman of the Jones campaign, said about 30 different calls have gone out to voters and \"most of them are local.\"<\/p>","<p>A political group overseen by Biden sent out a fundraising email to supporters Monday, asking for money to help the Jones campaign.<\/p>","<p>Throughout his campaign, Jones has tried to thread a needle, portraying himself as an independent figure who is unbeholden to party leaders in an attempt to win over Republicans. At the same time, he has relied on marquee national names to help boost Democratic turnout.<\/p>","<p>Jones is waging a vigorous effort to try to turn out African American voters, who Democratic officials believe will be critical to his chances.<\/p>","<p>American Possibilities, the political group overseen by Biden, sent out a fundraising appeal Monday promising to help \"support more candidates like Doug Jones.\"<\/p>","<p>\"We don't need another extremist in Washington,\" Biden wrote in the appeal.<\/p>","<p>Moore, who had not held a campaign event since Dec. 5, spoke in Midland City, Ala. Explaining why he didn't campaign this weekend, Moore told the crowd: \"I took approximately two and a half days to take my wife out of this mess and relax with my son at West Point.\"<\/p>","<p>The entrance to a flag-draped barn was decorated with plastic alligators and greenery, meant to evoke the Washington \"swamp,\" and gates were set up to separate several hundred Moore supporters from special guests who'd flown in for the final stretch.<\/p>","<p>\"What they're doing to Judge Roy Moore, they're going to try to do to every Trump supporter running for Congress next year,\" said Corey Stewart, a Prince William County supervisor who is running for the Republican nomination against Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., in 2018.<\/p>","<p>\"We dare defend our rights,\" Moore declared when he took the stage, quoting the Alabama motto that was used by state leaders in the 1960s, during the fight against desegregation. He spoke after his wife, Kayla Moore, defended his commitment to diversity.<\/p>","<p>\"My husband appointed the very first black marshal to the Alabama Supreme Court,\" she said. \"Fake news will tell you that we don't care for Jews. One of our attorneys is a Jew.\" The media, she added, needs to be \"held accountable\" for how it has covered the race.<\/p>","<p>Bannon, meanwhile, making his third trip to Alabama to endorse Moore, drew boos when he mentioned Shelby and \"little Bobby Corker,\" a reference to regular Trump critic Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn. Bannon suggested that Republican leaders might try to take out Trump \"as soon as they get that tax cut\" - and he even took an apparent shot at Trump's daughter, Ivanka, who has criticized Moore.<\/p>","<p>\"There's a special place in hell for Republicans who should know better,\" Bannon said, reworking a comment that Ivanka Trump had made about the misconduct allegations against Moore - one that was quickly turned into an ad by Jones.<\/p>","<p>Jones, who is focused on turning out African American voters, held a final campaign rally in Birmingham on Monday night, where he was joined on stage by basketball Hall of Famer Charles Barkley, actress Alyssa Milano and the city's newly elected mayor, Randall Woodfin, among others.<\/p>","<p>Barkley, an Alabama native, attacked Trump, Bannon and Moore in his brief opening remarks. Moore, he said, was appealing to \"the same people who've been holding us back for many, many years.\"<\/p>","<p>In a 10-minute speech, Jones framed the election as a momentous chapter in Alabama's history. \"This election is going to be one of the most significant in our state's history in a long time,\" he said. \"And we've got to make sure that at this crossroads in Alabama's history, we take the right road.\"<\/p>","<p>He also encouraged voters to put \"decency\" ahead of party loyalty and urged them to consider how Alabama will be viewed by business leaders as a result of the election.<\/p>","<p>Trump campaigned for Moore over the weekend from a distance. After touting him at a Friday evening rally just across the border in Florida, he recorded a phone call for him Saturday.<\/p>","<p>Senate Republican leaders withdrew their support of Moore in the wake of the women's allegations.

It was too loud to be a normal home vacuum cleaner or any other common domestic machinery.\"<\/p>","<p>A woman answered the door. \"I asked her name, but she wouldn't tell me,\" the reporter wrote. The sex offender tip turned out to be bogus. But Gumprecht later realized the woman at the door was Crews.<\/p>","<p>The same day, Fargo police hit a significant lead in the case. When interviewing co-workers at a Fargo roofing company where Crews's boyfriend worked, they learned he had been talking about a new baby at home. The evidence was enough for a search warrant, and on Thursday afternoon authorities raided the third-floor apartment.

It\u2019s a matter of making Janet, \u2018Janet\u2019 for that moment. A tour is a whole different thing because a tour is manufacturing her inspiration, manufacturing her visual, her view of what the tour is about. When we work on a tour, we always start conversations with images, references, collecting some months before.<\/p>","<p>Janet always makes you feel welcome, feel comfortable to express yourself. She is absolutely fantastic that way. She also is the creator of all the things. I\u2019m able to be in (the process of) sketching and design, but I listen to her. It is a fantastic and unique collaboration.<\/p>","<p><strong>Q.<\/strong> <strong><em>How is the costuming meant to reflect the mood of \u201cState of the World\u201d?<\/em><\/strong> <strong>A.<\/strong> Janet represents a very powerful human being, a strong woman, but at the same time a certain softness. Normally we\u2019d go into a futuristic approach to the costumes. At this point in time we went for a more approachable and a more street (take), but still remaining in futuristic ways. That\u2019s the expression of the state of the world \u2013 slightly dark, slightly light, too, because we use a lot of white. It\u2019s a mix of the world and all its beauty.<\/p>","<p><strong>Q.<\/strong> <strong><em>Janet is no stranger to touring and the importance of image. What things are you two doing differently now than, say, for the more pared-down feel of the last tour, \u201cUp and Close and Personal,\u201d in 2011? How are you pushing her to evolve?<\/em><\/strong><\/p>","<p><strong>A.<\/strong> (Chuckles) We don\u2019t push Janet to evolve. Janet constantly evolves. This is what I always say to her, \u201cThank you for allowing me to be a better me.\u201d She always has pushed me to further the look, to strengthen the image, and stuff like that. When it comes to creating, we have to remember that her tour is almost a straight hour and a half of dancing. We have to work around that; we have to work around finding exceptional fabrics that also are appropriate and help her throughout the show to be able to dance 90 minutes long. So we evolved with the fabrics.<\/p>","<p>We\u2019re always looking for stretch fabrics that allow her to bring her arm all the way up and bring it down, and the garment doesn\u2019t look crazy, or for her to go down and do the move to the floor, come up and still look intact. I\u2019m always in search of new and improved material. For example, the one that we have right now on tour is a bond and stretch, and it\u2019s matte \u2013 it doesn\u2019t shine; it has an elegance to it. Janet is an incredibly elegant woman. We want to keep that in mind \u2013 and also being able to dance. ... So it\u2019s sort of a puzzle to allow her to be active, but still look on point. <strong>Q.<\/strong> <strong><em>I\u2019m guessing there are multiples of costumes?<\/em><\/strong> <strong>A.<\/strong> Absolutely. ... Multiples of costumes for her, multiples of costumers for the dancers. There is always enough in case there is an accident. Listen, they dance. I have never seen people dance that hard, you know. The clothes have to be unbreakable. But that is not the reality of things, so there is a backup.<\/p>","<p><strong>Q.<\/strong> <strong><em>Are you present at every tour stop?<\/em><\/strong> <strong>A.<\/strong> No. We create the wardrobe. I do a few runs with her and then halfway through I\u2019ll do another couple more, just to make sure that everything is on point all the time.<\/p>","<p><strong>Q.<\/strong> <strong><em>How would the woman who is not a superstar channel Janet\u2019s effervescence when it comes to style?<\/em><\/strong><\/p>","<p><strong>A.<\/strong> (He interrupts the question, laughing.) She\u2019s got to be born with it! She\u2019s got to be born with it! What reflects Janet is individuality, and when a woman is an individual not driven by outside sources, is doing her own thing, that\u2019s when the magic happens \u2013 the grace and the elegance and the charisma comes. Because that makes you unique.<\/p>"]},{"uuid":"daeb2b25-63b1-5063-99bd-0802876a6911","title":"Trump says accusations of sexual misconduct against him are \"fabricated\"","type":"article","presentation":null,"url":"http:\/\/pilotonline.com\/news\/government\/politics\/nation\/trump-says-accusations-of-sexual-misconduct-against-him-are-fabricated\/article_daeb2b25-63b1-5063-99bd-0802876a6911.html","lastupdated":{"utc":"1513064689000","iso8601":"2017-12-12T02:44:49-05:00","rfc2822":"Tue, 12 Dec 2017 02:44:49 -0500"},"starttime":{"utc":"1513082580000","iso8601":"2017-12-12T07:43:00-05:00","rfc2822":"Tue, 12 Dec 2017 07:43:00 -0500"},"archivetime":{"uts":null,"iso8601":null,"rfc2822":null},"keywords":[],"sections":["news\/government\/politics\/nation"],"flags":[],"thumbnail":{"mode":"via .view","uuid":"daeb2b25-63b1-5063-99bd-0802876a6911","aspect_ratio":"100:67","aspect_ratio_x":100,"aspect_ratio_y":67,"file_size":263466,"height":67,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","url":"https:\/\/bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com\/pilotonline.com\/content\/tncms\/assets\/v3\/editorial\/4\/fa\/4fae5798-5bdf-5422-a64d-b5f3042827a0\/5a2fcf409c6c3.image.jpg?resize=100%2C67","resource_url":"https:\/\/bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com\/pilotonline.com\/content\/tncms\/assets\/v3\/editorial\/4\/fa\/4fae5798-5bdf-5422-a64d-b5f3042827a0\/5a2fcf409c6c3.image.jpg?resize=100%2C67","width":100},"preview":{"mode":"via .view","uuid":"daeb2b25-63b1-5063-99bd-0802876a6911","aspect_ratio":"640:427","aspect_ratio_x":640,"aspect_ratio_y":427,"file_size":263466,"height":427,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","url":"https:\/\/bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com\/pilotonline.com\/content\/tncms\/assets\/v3\/editorial\/4\/fa\/4fae5798-5bdf-5422-a64d-b5f3042827a0\/5a2fcf409c6c3.image.jpg?resize=640%2C427","resource_url":"https:\/\/bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com\/pilotonline.com\/content\/tncms\/assets\/v3\/editorial\/4\/fa\/4fae5798-5bdf-5422-a64d-b5f3042827a0\/5a2fcf409c6c3.image.jpg?resize=640%2C427","width":640},"authors":[],"prologue":"<p>Trump says Democrats \"have been unable to show any collusion with Russia\" and now are \"moving on\" to these allegations.

Weddle joined the organization in April 2016; talks about the changes began later that year.<\/p>","<p>\u201cThe alliance has had a governance plan that has been in place for 20 years or so and for whatever set of circumstances, reasons ... had become; I don\u2019t want to say dysfunctional, but it had become less than functional,\u201d he said.<\/p>","<p>Weddle added that more than half of the board members didn\u2019t attend meetings and there was not enough engagement.<\/p>","<p>As far as why members didn\u2019t attend, he said there could be a \u201cmyriad of answers\u201d but one \u201cobvious\u201d reason was \u201cthe organization in its previous structure and management had failed in some way to sufficiently engage them in the organization\u2019s mission and purpose to make it seem worth their while to attend a meeting.\u201d<\/p>","<p>Cutting back on the board will lead to increased efficiency, improved private investor engagement and more focused work on the organization\u2019s mission, Weddle said. He intends to make the positions more exclusive while keeping a 50-50 balance of representation from the private and public sectors.<\/p>","<p>\u201cIf you have an attendance below 50 percent for a good many years in a row, that by itself, would suggest that maybe you should take a good long look at what you\u2019re doing and what you\u2019re doing to improve that,\u201d Weddle said.<\/p>","<p>The current process requires a member to make a minimum $5,000 annual investment in the alliance to be guaranteed a seat on the board. But Weddle said there are many members who contribute more and having a low investment minimum could cause them to lower their investments as well.<\/p>","<p>\u201cIn the previous model, there was no ... difference in benefits that accrued from $5,000 and for someone with $50,000,\u201d he said. \u201cSo why would you invest more than $5,000?\u201d<\/p>","<p>Along with a new process that will require board members to be chosen through an annual nominating committee, a new tiered investment system with graduated benefits will be implemented.<\/p>","<p>The system will begin with a Corporate Council minimum investment level of $10,000 for all investors, excluding small businesses or nonprofits.<\/p>","<p>The benefits tied into certain investor levels include event invitations, partner co-branding, event and program sponsor recognition, and hosting of corporate relocation and site selector events.<\/p>","<p>The executive committee, which currently has nearly 25 members, will be cut to nine voting members.<\/p>","<p>Regional economic development directors will meet at least every other month. That group will expand to include private sector firms that have a full-time economic development staff position and make an annual investment of $15,000 to $24,999.<\/p>","<p>The feedback on the changes to the governance model has been largely positive with some tweaks made since earlier versions, Weddle said.<\/p>","<p>The changes were unanimously approved by the alliance\u2019s executive committee meeting in November. The board of directors were to vote on the issue Dec. 14. Weddle said he expects the revisions to pass.<\/p>","<p>\u201cI think it\u2019s a good first step.

She had fought alongside her father when he was king and sat at his feet when he held court.<\/p>","<p>During the meeting with the Portuguese governor in 1622, the leader instructed Njinga to sit on a rug while he took a seat in a chair. Njinga motioned to a servant who got down on all fours forming a chair for Njinga.<\/p>","<p>Heywood said that as mean as that might sound, Njinga was not going to be cowered, and her entourage understood that. The leaders negotiated a truce. With the death of her brother two years later, Njinga assumed the kingdom\u2019s leadership.<\/p>","<p>During the next decades, Njinga fought constantly with the Portuguese, losing her throne for a few years, then eventually getting the government to recognize her authority. She converted to Christianity at one point, only because she knew it could help as she worked with other powers, including the Vatican and the Dutch.<\/p>","<p>\u201cThe survival of her state would only come if she had relationships with the papacy,\u201d Heywood said. \u201cThat\u2019s what I called spiritual diplomacy.\u201d<\/p>","<p>Njinga would outlive 11 Portuguese governors; she ruled until her death in 1663.

He was honored in 1980 as Norfolk\u2019s First Citizen.<\/p>","<p>For Brock, success in business afforded him the chance to focus on higher education and environmental stewardship, two areas which benefited greatly from his time and his generosity. He served on the Hampton Roads Community Foundation Board of Directors and spent 10 years as chair of the Randolph-Macon Board of Trustees.<\/p>","<p>He and his wife Joan were honored in 2015 with the national Outstanding Philanthropist award presented by the Association of Fundraising Professionals for their history of giving. At the time, they had given more than $40 million to charitable causes, much of it benefiting Hampton Roads.<\/p>","<p>Among other facilities, the Brocks are responsible for helping build the Chesapeake Bay Foundation\u2019s Brock Environmental Center, the M. Foscue Brock Institute for Community and Global Health at Eastern Virginia Medical School and the Brock Commons outdoor amphitheater at Old Dominion University.<\/p>","<p>They endowed the curator of American art position at the Chrysler Museum of Art, assisted ACCESS College Foundation programs and supported the United Way of South Hampton Roads\u2019 United for Children program.<\/p>","<p>To family and friends, the loss of these two men is surely difficult and emotional.

They were the only Hampton Roads team playing for a state title Sunday, and until someone knocks them off, they remain kings of the hill in the 757.<\/p>","<p>\u201cThere are a awful lot of Division 6 teams that would like to have been here three times,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThis is not easy. It\u2019s a grind and these kids had to battle.<\/p>","<p>\u201cThis speaks so well for our program.\u201d<\/p>","<p>Many of you may not remember, but for most of its 64 football seasons, Oscar Smith was largely an also- ran.<\/p>","<p>Morgan came to Chesapeake in 2002 and vowed to build Oscar Smith into a state power. Most were skeptical. Oscar Smith had just two winning records in the past 17 years, and hadn\u2019t won an outright Southeastern District title in four decades.<\/p>","<p>Morgan said he knew that Oscar Smith \u201cwas a sleeping giant.\u201d<\/p>","<p>\u201cThe program was waiting to be revitalized and re-invigorated,\u201d Morgan said. \u201cI saw the stadium, I saw the kids, our facilities. There\u2019s no reason why we couldn\u2019t do it.<\/p>","<p>\u201cNinety percent of the people thought I was crazy. People thought I was nuts.\u201d<\/p>","<p>But there were good athletes and a diverse student body . Oscar Smith long ago moved to a suburban location, away from urban South Norfolk. But those blue-collar, South Norfolk kids still attend school.<\/p>","<p>Morgan was an emotional hard-charging coach who demanded much of his players, including academic rigor.<\/p>","<p>He created a \u201cfamily\u201d atmosphere where players and coaches saw each other frequently off the field, and cared for each other in the off season.<\/p>","<p>It took him but one season to turn the program around: Oscar Smith was 7-3 in 2002. In 2003, the Tigers won their first Southeastern District title. They\u2019ve won or shared it ever since.<\/p>","<p>Oscar Smith won its first state title in 2008 and another in 2011.<\/p>","<p>The Tigers were one play from three more the past three seasons.<\/p>","<p>King\u2019s Fork coach Scottie Littles played at Landstown, when the Eagles often met the Tigers in the playoffs. He watched Morgan build Oscar Smith into a powerhouse.<\/p>","<p>\u201cRichard Morgan built a culture of success there,\u201d Littles said. \u201cYou coach harder, you play harder, you do everything a little bit better when you have to live up to that standard.\u201d<\/p>","<p>Morgan said \u201cI\u2019m proud of what we did there, and I\u2019m proud of the kids and coaches for maintaining it.\u201d<\/p>","<p>Sunday\u2019s game was uncharacteristic for Oscar Smith, which is generally a disciplined team that doesn\u2019t beat itself.<\/p>","<p>That wasn\u2019t the case at Armstrong Stadium, as Oscar Smith had a season-high five turnovers and the Bulldogs just two. Oscar Smith had ten penalties, including several that helped lead to two Westfield touchdowns.<\/p>","<p>Cam\u2019Ron Kelly, the four-star junior, was magnificent, and you can see why Alabama, Ohio State and Virginia Tech are beating down his door with scholarship offers.<\/p>","<p>Playing offense and defense, he ran 71 yards for a touchdown, caught a 52-yard TD pass and intercepted and returned the ball 38 yards to the Westfield 23 with just 3:57 left.<\/p>","<p>But not even Kelly\u2019s heroics were enough to overcome to many mistakes.<\/p>","<p>Kelly paid homage to both Dee and Johnson at game\u2019s end.<\/p>","<p>\u201cThey always preached to us that we\u2019re a family,\u201d he said. \u201cThat didn\u2019t change. We know our brothers have our back. We never gave up on each other.<\/p>","<p>\u201cEverybody here has heart.\u201d<\/p>","<p>And a lot to be proud of.<\/p>"]},{"uuid":"f2d85954-b81b-5fa7-835c-3b9db2bf0a86","title":"High school scoreboard | Monday's scores and highlights, Tuesday's schedule","type":"article","presentation":null,"url":"http:\/\/pilotonline.com\/sports\/high-school-scoreboard-monday-s-scores-and-highlights-tuesday-s\/article_f2d85954-b81b-5fa7-835c-3b9db2bf0a86.html","lastupdated":{"utc":"1513099247000","iso8601":"2017-12-12T12:20:47-05:00","rfc2822":"Tue, 12 Dec 2017 12:20:47 -0500"},"starttime":{"utc":"1513049400000","iso8601":"2017-12-11T22:30:00-05:00","rfc2822":"Mon, 11 Dec 2017 22:30:00 -0500"},"archivetime":{"uts":null,"iso8601":null,"rfc2822":null},"keywords":["#757teamz"],"sections":["sports","sports\/high-school","sports\/high-school\/scores"],"flags":[],"thumbnail":{"mode":"via .view","uuid":"f2d85954-b81b-5fa7-835c-3b9db2bf0a86","aspect_ratio":"2:1","aspect_ratio_x":2,"aspect_ratio_y":1,"file_size":661644,"height":50,"mime_type":"image\/png","url":"https:\/\/bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com\/pilotonline.com\/content\/tncms\/assets\/v3\/editorial\/d\/fc\/dfc01ebf-c0ca-55df-9258-ad897f9bbc71\/5a20519698de7.image.png?resize=100%2C50","resource_url":"https:\/\/bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com\/pilotonline.com\/content\/tncms\/assets\/v3\/editorial\/d\/fc\/dfc01ebf-c0ca-55df-9258-ad897f9bbc71\/5a20519698de7.image.png?resize=100%2C50","width":100},"preview":{"mode":"via .view","uuid":"f2d85954-b81b-5fa7-835c-3b9db2bf0a86","aspect_ratio":"2:1","aspect_ratio_x":2,"aspect_ratio_y":1,"file_size":661644,"height":320,"mime_type":"image\/png","url":"https:\/\/bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com\/pilotonline.com\/content\/tncms\/assets\/v3\/editorial\/d\/fc\/dfc01ebf-c0ca-55df-9258-ad897f9bbc71\/5a20519698de7.image.png?resize=640%2C320","resource_url":"https:\/\/bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com\/pilotonline.com\/content\/tncms\/assets\/v3\/editorial\/d\/fc\/dfc01ebf-c0ca-55df-9258-ad897f9bbc71\/5a20519698de7.image.png?resize=640%2C320","width":640},"authors":[],"prologue":"","subheadline":"","tagline":"<p>Kyle Hampson, 757-446-2370, kyle.hampson@pilotonline.com<\/p>","byline":"","hammer":"","kicker":"","content":["<h1>Boys basketball<\/h1>","<h3><strong>Private schools<\/strong><\/h3>","<div><strong>Nansemond-Suffolk 66, Portsmouth Christian59<\/strong><\/div>","<div>\u00a0<\/div>","<div>NANSEMOND-SUFFOLK: White 8, Freeman 23, Salmon 9, Spencer 8, Knierbein 16.<\/div>","<div>PORTSMOUTH CHRISTIAN: Curry 3, Goodman 15, Austin 12, Eshelman 9, Wheeler 20.<\/div>","<div>\u00a0<\/div>","<div><strong>Park View-South Hill 59, Franklin 52<\/strong><\/div>","<div>\u00a0<\/div>","<div>Drelyn Ford scored 12 points ans grabbed 17 rebounds for Franklin.<\/div>","<div><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/div>","<div><strong>Veritas Collegiate 67, Beach Breakers 43<\/strong><\/div>","<div>\u00a0<\/div>","<div>Keshaun Roundtree scored 20 points and four assists.

An attorney for Ferrick, James K. Freeman, said in an email that the \"allegations are without merit,\" but declined further comment.<\/p>","<p>The student, Eric Trammel, recalled that the November morning began like so many before, with a familiar morning ritual at Centreville.<\/p>","<p>Students around Trammel rose for the Pledge of Allegiance. But the sophomore did as he has for more than a year: He remained seated.<\/p>","<p>This time, Ferrick ordered the 15-year-old to rise, Trammel recalled. When he refused, Ferrick pulled Trammel by the arm and sent him outside, the teenager said.<\/p>","<p>\"He was really angry when he grabbed my arm,\" Trammel said. \"I just never really saw it coming.\"<\/p>","<p>Employees in the Fairfax County Public Schools are forbidden from disciplining students who do not participate in the pledge, according to district policy. Students who abstain are expected to sit or stand quietly, the policy states.<\/p>","<p>The school district declined to say if the teacher was fired because it does not publicly discuss personnel matters.<\/p>","<p>Trammel hasn't stood for the morning recitation since encountering the Black Lives Matter movement on Twitter during the eighth grade. He views the quiet demonstration as his way of drawing attention to unequal racial treatment and other forms of inequality, he said.<\/p>","<p>\"The country is in a very divided place right now and there's a lot of injustices around the U.S. I feel like me sitting can spread awareness to that,\" Trammel said. \"I don't believe in forcing other people to sit. . . . That's just a personal decision.\"<\/p>","<p>Similar actions have captured national attention.<\/p>","<p>In 2016, Colin Kaepernick became one of the country'smost polarizing sports figures when, as a former quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers, he took a knee during the national anthem in protest of police violence against black people.<\/p>","<p>Kaepernick gained renewed attention earlier this year after President Donald Trump, during a campaign rally in Alabama for Republican Sen. Luther Strange, went off topic and said, \"Wouldn't you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, 'Get that son of a bitch off the field right now, out. He's fired. He's fired!' \"<\/p>","<p>Unlike the animated national discourse ignited by Trump's remarks and subsequent tweets, Trammel's display drew little fuss until Nov. 14, he said. It was his second day in driver's education class, he said, when Ferrick spotted him sitting for the Pledge of Allegiance during first period.<\/p>","<p>After being thrown out of class, Trammel said he spent 20 minutes outside in the cold before knocking and asking Ferrick if he could return. The teacher allegedly refused unless Trammel agreed to stand for the pledge.<\/p>","<p>\"This isn't the NFL,\" Trammel recalled the teacher saying.<\/p>","<p>\"This has nothing to do with the NFL,\" Trammel said he responded, adding that he explained to Ferrick that he had the right to sit through the pledge.<\/p>","<p>When the teacher refused to let Trammel return, the teen said he went to school administrators, who walked with him back to class.<\/p>","<p>The administrators, whom Trammel declined to name, spoke with Ferrick as Trammel returned to class and quietly took notes. The teacher, Trammel said, pulled him aside after class.<\/p>","<p>\"He told me that our relationship had drastically changed, that what he thought of me was different,\" Trammel said. \"He also moved me to the back of the classroom.\"<\/p>","<p>Trammel detailed the encounter in a text message to his mother, Angela Trammel, soon after.<\/p>","<p>\"I was respectful and said it is a right I have to sit in class and he basically tried to say his class rules override that,\" Angela Trammel said her son wrote.<\/p>","<p>The mother said she was unaware her son felt so fiercely about the Pledge of Allegiance.<\/p>","<p>\"I'm pretty proud of his courage. I'm more proud that he behaved well throughout his courage,\" she said. \"As a mother, I want Eric to know he's going to be protected and he doesn't have to make any concessions when he's been mistreated, ever.\"<\/p>","<p>The family is looking into legal options. Victor M.

Plaintiffs' lawsuit challenging military service requirements is premature for many reasons, including that the Defense Department is actively reviewing such service requirements, as the President ordered, and because none of the Plaintiffs have established that they will be impacted by current policies on military service.\"<\/p>","<p>In July, President Donald Trump surprised military leaders and members of Congress when he announced the proposal in a series of tweets. Trump's order reversed an Obama-era policy allowing transgender men and women to serve openly and to receive funding for sex-reassignment surgery.<\/p>","<p>In October, Kollar-Kotelly found challengers likely to prevail in asserting that the president's order violates equal-protection guarantees in the Constitution. The administration has appealed the ruling, and in the meantime asked the judge to temporarily postpone the recruitment requirement until the case is resolved.<\/p>","<p>Forcing the military to accept transgender applicants and implement such a significant change in policy may \"negatively impact military readiness,\" government lawyers said in asking for the delay.<\/p>","<p>Attorneys for the plaintiffs said in court filings that the military had already been preparing to accept transgender recruits. Before the change in administration, the Defense Department was gearing up to accept transgender applicants starting in July 2017 and had started training and other preparations.<\/p>","<p>\"The government cannot credibly claim that it will be irreparably harmed by implementing a policy that it was on track to implement almost six months ago,\" according to the filing from the plaintiffs.<\/p>"]},{"uuid":"99121d68-2525-5d20-ae45-89e49b2e2eda","title":"In Your Dreams Event Design & Planning | Startup spotlight","type":"article","presentation":null,"url":"http:\/\/pilotonline.com\/inside-business\/news\/economic-development\/in-your-dreams-event-design-planning-startup-spotlight\/article_99121d68-2525-5d20-ae45-89e49b2e2eda.html","lastupdated":{"utc":"1513101227000","iso8601":"2017-12-12T12:53:47-05:00","rfc2822":"Tue, 12 Dec 2017 12:53:47 -0500"},"starttime":{"utc":"1513024020000","iso8601":"2017-12-11T15:27:00-05:00","rfc2822":"Mon, 11 Dec 2017 15:27:00 -0500"},"archivetime":{"uts":null,"iso8601":null,"rfc2822":null},"keywords":["in your dreams event design and planning","zoe whitaker","business startup","#startupspotlight"],"sections":["inside-business\/news\/economic-development","inside-business\/news\/small-business"],"flags":[],"thumbnail":{"mode":"via .view","uuid":"99121d68-2525-5d20-ae45-89e49b2e2eda","aspect_ratio":"100:149","aspect_ratio_x":100,"aspect_ratio_y":149,"file_size":212494,"height":149,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","url":"https:\/\/bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com\/pilotonline.com\/content\/tncms\/assets\/v3\/editorial\/f\/e4\/fe41fdf0-1b84-503d-8160-dc711fec0038\/5a2ffb130e269.image.jpg?resize=100%2C149","resource_url":"https:\/\/bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com\/pilotonline.com\/content\/tncms\/assets\/v3\/editorial\/f\/e4\/fe41fdf0-1b84-503d-8160-dc711fec0038\/5a2ffb130e269.image.jpg?resize=100%2C149","width":100},"preview":{"mode":"via .view","uuid":"99121d68-2525-5d20-ae45-89e49b2e2eda","aspect_ratio":"640:951","aspect_ratio_x":640,"aspect_ratio_y":951,"file_size":212494,"height":951,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","url":"https:\/\/bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com\/pilotonline.com\/content\/tncms\/assets\/v3\/editorial\/f\/e4\/fe41fdf0-1b84-503d-8160-dc711fec0038\/5a2ffb130e269.image.jpg?resize=640%2C951","resource_url":"https:\/\/bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com\/pilotonline.com\/content\/tncms\/assets\/v3\/editorial\/f\/e4\/fe41fdf0-1b84-503d-8160-dc711fec0038\/5a2ffb130e269.image.jpg?resize=640%2C951","width":640},"authors":[],"prologue":"","subheadline":"","tagline":"","byline":"","hammer":"","kicker":"","content":["<p>Business name: In Your Dreams Event Design and Planning LLC<\/p>","<p>Owner: Zoe L.

In Your Dreams Event Design and Planning helps women save time and reduce stress by decorating her special event. We offer three levels of service to meet any budget: full design and decor; custom rentals; event staff help to set up and break down.<\/p>","<p>Background: I am a retired registered nurse and a retired officer from the USAF Reserves. I loved nursing, but I always had a burning desire to own a business; however the fear of the unknown, expectations of others and not knowing what type of business all kept me enslaved to Plan B.<\/p>","<p>Do you remember the moment you decided to start your business? What was that like? Yes, and it was scary! My last nursing assignment was as a contractor. During the last few years of my contract I became increasingly anxious, as though I was on a hamster wheel. Fortunately for me, fate stepped in and my contract suddenly ended. I was 50 years old and at a serious crossroads. In my heart I knew the pain of staying the same was greater than the pain of changing. Metaphorically speaking, I chose the island of my dreams, burned the boat and never looked back.<\/p>","<p>What motivates you? Three things motivate me. I want so much for my family to be proud of me. I desire to help and be an inspiration to those who are living their Plan B. Perhaps, my story will propel them past the fear and catapult someone to start living their dreams. Finally, I don\u2019t want to harbor resentment toward myself for never giving it an honest try.<\/p>","<p>What has been the biggest challenge so far? You say challenge, I say challenges. Learning and executing the business of business. Defining what I want my business to be, and being OK with that choice. I cannot omit maintaining a healthy work-life balance.<\/p>","<p>How do you define success? Success is a series of tiny steps you take every day that brings you closer to absolute fullness of live and ultimately becoming the human being you were meant to be.<\/p>","<p>Online: InYourDreamsEventPlanning.com<\/p>","<p>Contact: zoe@inyourdreams eventplanning.com<\/p>"]},{"uuid":"4524ee45-da37-56cb-9e7d-466dbdab86bb","title":"Renelle Roberts, voice-over actress | First person","type":"article","presentation":null,"url":"http:\/\/pilotonline.com\/inside-business\/news\/first-person-features\/renelle-roberts-voice-over-actress-first-person\/article_4524ee45-da37-56cb-9e7d-466dbdab86bb.html","lastupdated":{"utc":"1513087667000","iso8601":"2017-12-12T09:07:47-05:00","rfc2822":"Tue, 12 Dec 2017 09:07:47 -0500"},"starttime":{"utc":"1513023720000","iso8601":"2017-12-11T15:22:00-05:00","rfc2822":"Mon, 11 Dec 2017 15:22:00 -0500"},"archivetime":{"uts":null,"iso8601":null,"rfc2822":null},"keywords":["renelle roberts","southern connecticut state university","regent university","cbn","abc family channel\/freeform","miss connecticut","inside business","casey roberts","chamber of commerce","virginia production alliance","virginia symphony","hurrah players","#ib-email-wed","#ib4"],"sections":["inside-business\/news\/first-person-features","inside-business\/news\/small-business"],"flags":[],"thumbnail":{"mode":"via .view","uuid":"4524ee45-da37-56cb-9e7d-466dbdab86bb","aspect_ratio":"2:3","aspect_ratio_x":2,"aspect_ratio_y":3,"file_size":86607,"height":150,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","url":"https:\/\/bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com\/pilotonline.com\/content\/tncms\/assets\/v3\/editorial\/8\/6e\/86e2875c-8362-5523-847b-f17e16550b22\/5a2855530999f.image.jpg?resize=100%2C150","resource_url":"https:\/\/bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com\/pilotonline.com\/content\/tncms\/assets\/v3\/editorial\/8\/6e\/86e2875c-8362-5523-847b-f17e16550b22\/5a2855530999f.image.jpg?resize=100%2C150","width":100},"preview":{"mode":"via .view","uuid":"4524ee45-da37-56cb-9e7d-466dbdab86bb","aspect_ratio":"2:3","aspect_ratio_x":2,"aspect_ratio_y":3,"file_size":86607,"height":960,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","url":"https:\/\/bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com\/pilotonline.com\/content\/tncms\/assets\/v3\/editorial\/8\/6e\/86e2875c-8362-5523-847b-f17e16550b22\/5a2855530999f.image.jpg","resource_url":"https:\/\/bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com\/pilotonline.com\/content\/tncms\/assets\/v3\/editorial\/8\/6e\/86e2875c-8362-5523-847b-f17e16550b22\/5a2855530999f.image.jpg","width":640},"authors":[{"avatar":"https:\/\/pilotonline.com\/pilotonline.com\/content\/tncms\/avatars\/6\/ff\/23b\/6ff23b4e-6225-11e5-8b8c-10604b9ffe60.054d6ea2ddcf2e32e3bb2dd487da571f.png","byline":null,"first_name":"Sandra J.","last_name":"Pennecke","screen_name":"Sandra Pennecke","uuid":"6ff23b4e-6225-11e5-8b8c-10604b9ffe60"}],"prologue":"<p>A former reporter, Roberts now uses her voice to inspire and sell, performing voice-over work such as commercials and e-learning videos for businesses.<\/p>","subheadline":"","tagline":"","byline":"By Sandra J.

For almost a decade, Roberts worked as a television features producer and reporter for CBN through its affiliate Freeform, formerly the ABC Family channel.<\/p>","<p>Her husband, Casey, is a principal at Smithfield High School.

So it\u2019s been a blessing. It\u2019s been a dream come true really,\u201d Roberts said.<\/p>","<p>CHILDHOOD DREAMS COME TRUE<\/p>","<p>\u201cI wanted to be an entertainment reporter actually when I was a little girl. I always wanted to be in television. We didn\u2019t have cable growing up, we only had channel 8 (ABC) at our house. So my celebrities were my local news reporters and national news reporters. That\u2019s just all I saw because that\u2019s all we had. So, I would write fan letters to them and that\u2019s what I wanted to be.<\/p>","<p>\u201cI also had another dream of being Miss America, which I think a lot of little girls back then dreamt of. I did actually get to partially accomplish that. I was a junior in college at 18 when I won the Miss Connecticut title and got to compete in Miss America \u2026 it was so much fun and that also opened me up to a wider spectrum of journalism because when you\u2019re Miss Connecticut for a year, you\u2019re doing lots of appearances and you\u2019re with reporters a lot. That kind of just showed me even more of what print and broadcast journalism are about and that helped fuel my love for reporting.\u201d<\/p>","<p>COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT<\/p>","<p>\u201cI am a member of the (Hampton Roads) Chamber of Commerce. I love going to chamber events. I\u2019m also a member of the Virginia Production Alliance. There are wonderful gatherings where we get to meet people in the industry. And so those are wonderful groups that I highly endorse. The chamber has been wonderful for learning about the local businesses and the Virginia Production Alliance is great because it gets me to meet people not just in Hampton roads, but people all over Virginia involved in film and television production. And so that\u2019s been really really helpful.\u201d<\/p>","<p>SPARE TIME<\/p>","<p>\u201cWe love to go for walks. My daughter is really into violin, so as a family we like to go to the Virginia Symphony orchestra performances, especially their kids\u2019 performances. We love musical theater, so we like supporting the Hurrah Players, anything that comes to the Chrysler. \u2026 Every summer, we do take a family vacation to Martha\u2019s Vineyard with our extended family. That\u2019s one of the highlights of our year\u2026relaxing, playing board games and that kind of thing. Just being out in nature, being together as a family and that brings us a lot of joy.\u201d<\/p>","<p>HUMANITARIAN WORK<\/p>","<p>\u201cMy husband and I are very passionate about humanitarian work. We\u2019ve gone together to Southern India\u2026we help out at a children\u2019s home and help widows. We\u2019re hoping to take our daughter when she\u2019s a bit older. ... We\u2019ve been involved for the last 10 years in helping out there and supplying school uniforms for the children and shoes for them and supporting a local school there. It\u2019s important to live our own lives, but we also need to remember that there are people who are less fortunate in our country and other countries. And to keep that as something primary in our radar so we don\u2019t just get consumed with ourselves.\u201d<\/p>","<p>10 YEARS FROM NOW<\/p>","<p>\u201cI really see myself just continuing down this path.

Some of the loudest and youngest among them prepared to demonstrate \u2014 and perhaps get arrested \u2014 before the proceedings were over. Dozens of police cars outside indicated the authorities were expecting trouble too.<\/p>","<p>Instead, the sometimes-raucous meeting ended with confusion, not uproar, and a partial victory for foes of the natural gas pipeline. Though a few protesters were escorted out after ignoring warnings to quiet down, police said there were no arrests.<\/p>","<p>The members of the State Water Control Board approved a certification for the controversial project, but the 4-3 vote was only a tentative endorsement. The board delayed its effective date, reserving the option of voting again on the project after the Department of Environmental Quality staff completes reviews of the pipeline partners\u2019 plans to address a range of issues. Among unresolved matters: controls on stormwater runoff and erosion protections for steep mountain slopes.<\/p>","<p>The outcome left opponents comparing notes and offering somewhat different interpretations. It caught the project\u2019s lead partner, Dominion Energy, off guard. The company is considered Virginia\u2019s most politically powerful, and its project has enjoyed the backing of Gov. Terry McAuliffe, who appointed the members of the water board. In addition, the board last week issued a certification for another highly contested project, the Mountain Valley Pipeline, with few stipulations.<\/p>","<p>In a statement several hours after the vote, Dominion spokesman Aaron Ruby called the board action a \u201cmajor step toward final approval\u201d and said the company will work closely with DEQ \u201cto complete all remaining approvals in a timely manner and ensure we meet all conditions of the certification.\u201d<\/p>","<p>Dominion had once indicated it hoped to begin construction of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline before year\u2019s end, but Bill Hayden, a DEQ spokesman, said he didn\u2019t see how that was possible. Hayden said it wasn\u2019t clear how long the staff reviews the board decided to wait for would take.<\/p>","<p>The 600-mile pipeline would carry fracked natural gas from the mountains of West Virginia to the lowlands of eastern North Carolina, with a spur into Hampton Roads ending in Chesapeake.<\/p>","<p>Dominion has made the $5 billion line a centerpiece of its long-term energy strategy, arguing it would help it continue its move away from dirtier-burning coal as a fuel source while meeting a growing demand for electricity. Much of Virginia\u2019s business and labor community, and most members of Hampton Roads\u2019 General Assembly delegation have voiced support, citing Dominion\u2019s claims that it would create 13,000 construction jobs and lower electricity prices.<\/p>","<p>Critics, including environmentalists and many landowners along the route, have said the construction would irreparably damage streams and rivers. They argue the project would drive up electricity prices and have called on Dominion to invest more in solar, wind and other renewable sources.<\/p>","<p>More than 20,000 public comments, most in opposition, have been submitted to state environmental regulators on the project. Opponents outnumbered supporters again Monday, when the water board invited public speakers.<\/p>","<p>Tuesday was devoted to the DEQ staff\u2019s review of the pipeline, and though that work is not finished, the staff recommended the board give its certification.<\/p>","<p>That troubled some board members, including Roberta Kellam from Northampton County. She said they needed more information before signing off and called for an unequivocal rejection.<\/p>","<p>Some members who did vote for the provisional certification said they did so despite concerns that a delay on final action might cost the board its right to impose water-quality guidelines. They noted that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which approved the project in October, has a one-year window during which state officials must act or waive their oversight. Hayden said it isn\u2019t clear when that countdown began.<\/p>","<p>David Sligh, conservation director for the nonprofit group Wild Virginia, praised the board for acknowledging that \u201cthe process is flawed and they can\u2019t in good faith make a final decision without all the information.\u201d<\/p>"]},{"uuid":"b32fa4ef-81e4-558d-9ae6-f13f7e9f912c","title":"It was \"heartbreaking\" for Trump's accusers to see him elected despite sexual misconduct allegations","type":"article","presentation":null,"url":"http:\/\/pilotonline.com\/news\/government\/nation\/it-was-heartbreaking-for-trump-s-accusers-to-see-him\/article_b32fa4ef-81e4-558d-9ae6-f13f7e9f912c.html","lastupdated":{"utc":"1513002047000","iso8601":"2017-12-11T09:20:47-05:00","rfc2822":"Mon, 11 Dec 2017 09:20:47 -0500"},"starttime":{"utc":"1513019460000","iso8601":"2017-12-11T14:11:00-05:00","rfc2822":"Mon, 11 Dec 2017 14:11:00 -0500"},"archivetime":{"uts":null,"iso8601":null,"rfc2822":null},"keywords":[],"sections":["news\/government\/nation"],"flags":[],"thumbnail":{"mode":"via .view","uuid":"b32fa4ef-81e4-558d-9ae6-f13f7e9f912c","aspect_ratio":"100:67","aspect_ratio_x":100,"aspect_ratio_y":67,"file_size":33693,"height":67,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","url":"https:\/\/bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com\/pilotonline.com\/content\/tncms\/assets\/v3\/editorial\/4\/8a\/48ae6ca7-b6b4-5082-8a04-d991ef4b1e66\/5a2ed8aec73d7.image.jpg?resize=100%2C67","resource_url":"https:\/\/bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com\/pilotonline.com\/content\/tncms\/assets\/v3\/editorial\/4\/8a\/48ae6ca7-b6b4-5082-8a04-d991ef4b1e66\/5a2ed8aec73d7.image.jpg?resize=100%2C67","width":100},"preview":{"mode":"via .view","uuid":"b32fa4ef-81e4-558d-9ae6-f13f7e9f912c","aspect_ratio":"320:213","aspect_ratio_x":320,"aspect_ratio_y":213,"file_size":33693,"height":426,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","url":"https:\/\/bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com\/pilotonline.com\/content\/tncms\/assets\/v3\/editorial\/4\/8a\/48ae6ca7-b6b4-5082-8a04-d991ef4b1e66\/5a2ed8aec73d7.image.jpg","resource_url":"https:\/\/bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com\/pilotonline.com\/content\/tncms\/assets\/v3\/editorial\/4\/8a\/48ae6ca7-b6b4-5082-8a04-d991ef4b1e66\/5a2ed8aec73d7.image.jpg","width":640},"authors":[],"prologue":"<p>Trump has denied all of the allegations against him, which were made public after The Washington Post published an \"Access Hollywood\" recording of Trump boasting about grabbing women by the genitals in October 2016.<\/p>","subheadline":"","tagline":"","byline":"By Mark Berman\n<br> The Washington Post","hammer":"","kicker":"","content":["<p>As the country grapples with a national reckoning over sexual misconduct allegations against powerful men from Hollywood to Capitol Hill, three women who accused the most high-profile man in the country again questioned Monday why their claims did nothing to stop him from winning the presidency.<\/p>","<p>It was \"heartbreaking\" for women to go public with their claims against President Donald Trump last year, only to see him ascend to the Oval Office, said Samantha Holvey, a former Miss USA contestant who in October 2016 said Trump inappropriately inspected pageant participants.<\/p>","<p>\"I put myself out there for the entire world and nobody cared,\" Holvey said on NBC's \"Megyn Kelly Today\" show, appearing for an hour alongside Jessica Leeds, a New York woman who said Trump groped her on a plane, and Rachel Crooks, who said Trump kissed her on the lips after she introduced herself to him at Trump Tower.<\/p>","<p>Trump has denied all of the allegations against him, which were made public after The Washington Post published an \"Access Hollywood\" recording of Trump boasting about grabbing women by the genitals in October 2016. The White House's position is that Trump's accusers are lying and that the issue was settled when he was elected president after the stories emerged.<\/p>","<p>\"These false claims, totally disputed in most cases by eyewitness accounts, were addressed at length during last year's campaign, and the American people voiced their judgment by delivering a decisive victory,\" the White House said in a statement Monday. \"The timing and absurdity of these false claims speaks volumes, and the publicity tour that has begun only further confirms the political motives behind them.\"<\/p>","<p>Speaking to Megyn Kelly on Monday in their first joint interview, the women recounted their allegations against Trump, describing how they felt threatened and disgusted by their encounters with him.<\/p>","<p>\"I was shocked,\" Crooks told Kelly after describing Trump kissing her at Trump Tower. \"Devastated. It happened so fast ... I wish I would've been courageous enough to say, 'What's going on and you need to stop this.'\"<\/p>","<p>Crooks said she felt at the time that she had no way to respond to the situation out of fear that if she reported it to her bosses - who did business with Trump's organization - she might lose her job. \"I wish I had been stronger,\" she said. Crooks said she came forward after reading an account from another woman accusing Trump of misconduct, saying that this made her feel a sense of relief knowing that \"it wasn't just me.\"<\/p>","<p>The three women spoke on \"Today\" before holding a news conference in Manhattan amid a wave of allegations of sexual assault and harassment by men that have swept across the country in recent weeks that has stretched into fields including politics, entertainment, the media, the courts and the finance industry.<\/p>","<p>Numerous high-profile men have been fired or suspended from their jobs, including Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein and broadcaster Charlie Rose, while others have announced plans to step down, including Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn., and Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., both of whom said last week that they would leave Congress over the mounting allegations.<\/p>","<p>Holvey suggested it made sense for Trump's accusers to speak to the public again given the way the country's atmosphere - and response to alleged sexual misconduct - has shifted over the last year.<\/p>","<p>\"Let's try round two,\" she said. \"The environment's different, let's try again.\"<\/p>","<p>A day before the women spoke, Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said that women who have accused Trump \"should be heard.\" Haley's comments were a sharp break from the White House's position, and they were particularly notable coming from one of the most high-profile women serving in Trump's administration.<\/p>","<p>\"They should be heard, and they should be dealt with,\" Haley said when asked on CBS's \"Face the Nation\" about the allegations other women have made against Trump. \"And I think we heard from them before the election. And I think any woman who has felt violated or felt mistreated in any way, they have every right to speak up.\"<\/p>","<p>The #MeToo movement has drawn renewed attention to the accusations against Trump, which emerged in the final weeks of the presidential campaign last year. When asked in October whether the White House's position was that all of the women are lying, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, Trump's press secretary, told reporters: \"Yeah, we've been clear on that from the beginning, and the president has spoken on it.\"<\/p>","<p>For women who accused Trump of sexual misconduct last year, watching other men felled by allegations has left them wondering why their claims did not have the same impact during the presidential campaign.<\/p>","<p>Trump has denied the allegations against him, vowing to sue his accusers and produce \"substantial evidence\" he said would disprove their claims. So far, he has not followed through on either promise.<\/p>","<p>One lawsuit has emerged from the allegations made against Trump: One of his accusers, Summer Zervos, sued him in New York for defamation over Trump's repeated comments that all of the women were liars.<\/p>","<p>Zervos, a former contestant on \"The Apprentice,\" said Trump kissed and groped her during a 2007 encounter at the Beverly Hills Hotel. In response, Trump said: \"False stories. All made up. Lies. Lies. No witnesses. No nothing.

While 401(k)s can help shelter compensation from taxes, the plans must follow federal limits for annual pretax contributions: $18,000 in 2017 for those under age 50 and $24,000 for those above.<\/p>","<p>These participant contribution limits combined with employer additions equal up to $54,000 total pretax contribution for those under age 50 and $60,000 for those above.<\/p>","<p>While this may seem like a nice chunk of change to sock away each year (and it is), for many business owners, the ability to replace income in retirement still falls short. The result is a significant \u201cincome replacement gap\u201d in retirement.<\/p>","<p>In contrast, participants in split-funded plans, which have defined benefits, need not adhere to any government-set maximums for their annual pretax contributions. Instead, maximum pretax contributions are calculated for each participant based on age and earnings, and according to a preset targeted return on the plan\u2019s assets.<\/p>","<p>What does that mean for a client who owns a professional practice or small business? With a cash-balance plan, an older, highly compensated practice-owning doctor, lawyer or business owner can park more than $250,000 a year in the pretax account \u2014 even as the costs of sponsoring and administering the plan for employees remain below those of a 401(k) plan.<\/p>","<p>Let\u2019s look at an example of how a split-funded plan plays out.<\/p>","<p>A husband and wife (John, 63 and Rachel, 62) have a successful business that employs 14, including a son and daughter (ages 36 and 38). The clients and the children have been making maximum contributions to a 401(k)\/profit-sharing plan.<\/p>","<p>Recently, the clients have begun discussing retiring in five years and passing the company to the son and daughter. Additionally, the need for increased income tax deduction was raised by the client\u2019s CPA.<\/p>","<p>While the clients were eager to retire, they realized they had taken much of the company profits and invested it back into the business. Furthermore, they had depleted much of their savings by funding the educations for their children.<\/p>","<p>The owners desired to contribute about $600,000 per year, pre-tax, for the next five years, to a custom pension plan.<\/p>","<p>The plan needed to address three concerns: quickly accumulate retirement income; contributions had to be income tax deductible; and the plan needed to include life insurance as one of the assets in order to protect the wealth transfer. If the three concerns could be addressed, the company could pass to the children effectively and the clients would have sufficient income for retirement.<\/p>","<p>The client\u2019s team of advisors worked to design the following:<\/p>","<p>\u2022 Total 401(k) for John and Rachel: $48,000<\/p>","<p>\u2022 Total split-funded defined benefit for John and Rachel: $550,000<\/p>","<p>\u2022 Required contribution for the employees: $43,000<\/p>","<p>\u2022 Total company tax deductible contribution: $641,000<\/p>","<p>In a 45 percent tax bracket, the $641,000 represented a tax savings of about $289,000 with John and Rachel realizing about 94 percent of the contribution for them.<\/p>","<p>In this scenario, the John and Rachel could contribute a much higher amount on a fully deductible basis thereby securing their need for income replacement in retirement as well as creating a successful transfer to children. Furthermore, their long-time, loyal employees benefited by receiving an annual contribution in addition to any previous qualified plan contributions.<\/p>","<p>Brent Saba is president of Allegiant Business Advisors.

Stevenson says greenery garlands can make a dramatic focal point just about anywhere, including on tables, chair backs, arches and trees.<\/p>","<p class=\"ctw_body\">\u201cCenterpieces are incorporating lanterns filled with flowers and fairy lights, elevated compote glass vases with large, unstructured greenery focused designs or streamlined modern, simpler designs in popular brass terrariums with succulents, flowers and sand,\u201d she adds.<\/p>","<p class=\"ctw_subheading\">Gushing Gold<\/p>","<p class=\"ctw_body\">Gold has a place too. \u201cThere will always be a place for the classics like white and blush, but there's definitely a rise in couples who are opting for bright, bold colors and unique blooms,\u201d Rogers says.<\/p>","<p class=\"ctw_body\">Janel Bailey-Keen, executive creative director for Vivid Expressions in Norfolk, Virginia, agrees, noting that a trending metallic is rose gold. As a luscious, luxurious and romantic tone, Bailey-Keen says rose gold is slightly more muted and antique in feel than other golds, and complements warmer colors like pinks, reds, orange and reddish purples. \u201cThe rose tone also pairs well with greens and other neutrals,\u201d Bailey-Keen notes.<\/p>","<p class=\"ctw_subheading\">Woodland Wonderland<\/p>","<p class=\"ctw_body\">As many ceremonies move to the outdoors, Stevenson says they embrace overall themes of woodland wonderland. \u201cThink tons of wild and free style florals with greenery as the focus,\u201d she says.<\/p>","<p class=\"ctw_body\">Common arrangements are handcrafted wooden arches adorned with assorted greenery and unique blooms like King Protea, pods mixed with peonies and garden roses, floral chandeliers and floral adorned lanterns in trees.<\/p>","<p class=\"ctw_body\">Rose petal aisles outdoors are also popular, Stevenson says. \u201cBrides are mixing it up by having petals in circles and other designs instead of the traditional more structured line down the middle of the aisle,\u201d she says.<\/p>","<p class=\"ctw_subheading\">Wearable Florals<\/p>","<p class=\"ctw_body\">To keep the woodland feel alive, brides are opting for wearable floral. \u201cIf not bohemian style crowns, then other types of floral headpieces,\u201d says Rogers.<\/p>","<p class=\"ctw_body\">They are also incorporating more florals into their bridal party, such as flowers woven into bridesmaid's updos and braids. \u201cThis trend has become so popular because it has a stunning effect with little effort and a low impact on their budget,\u201d says Stevenson.<\/p>","<p class=\"ctw_subheading\">Cascading Bouquets<\/p>","<p class=\"ctw_body\">Lush, billowing and cascading hand-tied bouquets are on the rise, according to Bailey-Keen. However, she cautions: \u201cBe sure to work with a florist who can create an impressive bouquet, but scale it to be proportional \u2013 we've see a lot of enormous bouquets that are so large they seem to carry the bride and camouflage her and her gown,\u201d Bailey-Keen says.<\/p>","<p class=\"ctw_subheading\">Masculine Bouts<\/p>","<p class=\"ctw_body\">Grooms are ditching traditional boutonnieres for simple pocket squares, says Rogers. \u201cWhat I love (and predict could be popular in the future) are box bouts \u2013 best described as floral pocket squares,\" he says.<\/p>","<p class=\"ctw_body\">Stevenson points out that floral boutonnieres are also becoming more fun and masculine, \u201cwith grooms forgoing the old single rose tradition.\u201d<\/p>","<p class=\"ctw_body\"><em>\u00a9 Brides 365<\/em><\/p>"]},{"uuid":"5b64926c-f966-525b-9729-85bb679ecdc6","title":"Town Point Club invites you to help make some holiday magic","type":"article","presentation":null,"url":"http:\/\/pilotonline.com\/life\/flavor\/restaurants\/turning-tables\/town-point-club-invites-you-to-help-make-some-holiday\/article_5b64926c-f966-525b-9729-85bb679ecdc6.html","lastupdated":{"utc":"1512993527000","iso8601":"2017-12-11T06:58:47-05:00","rfc2822":"Mon, 11 Dec 2017 06:58:47 -0500"},"starttime":{"utc":"1513011480000","iso8601":"2017-12-11T11:58:00-05:00","rfc2822":"Mon, 11 Dec 2017 11:58:00 -0500"},"archivetime":{"uts":null,"iso8601":null,"rfc2822":null},"keywords":["town point club","norfolk","charity","eddie lee bryant"],"sections":["life\/flavor\/restaurants\/turning-tables"],"flags":[],"thumbnail":{"mode":"via .view","uuid":"5b64926c-f966-525b-9729-85bb679ecdc6","aspect_ratio":"100:133","aspect_ratio_x":100,"aspect_ratio_y":133,"file_size":57852,"height":133,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","url":"https:\/\/bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com\/pilotonline.com\/content\/tncms\/assets\/v3\/editorial\/c\/87\/c8744c79-3fd2-540c-b1ca-b36723d2edac\/5a2eb94762c3e.image.jpg?resize=100%2C133","resource_url":"https:\/\/bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com\/pilotonline.com\/content\/tncms\/assets\/v3\/editorial\/c\/87\/c8744c79-3fd2-540c-b1ca-b36723d2edac\/5a2eb94762c3e.image.jpg?resize=100%2C133","width":100},"preview":{"mode":"via .view","uuid":"5b64926c-f966-525b-9729-85bb679ecdc6","aspect_ratio":"640:853","aspect_ratio_x":640,"aspect_ratio_y":853,"file_size":57852,"height":853,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","url":"https:\/\/bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com\/pilotonline.com\/content\/tncms\/assets\/v3\/editorial\/c\/87\/c8744c79-3fd2-540c-b1ca-b36723d2edac\/5a2eb94762c3e.image.jpg","resource_url":"https:\/\/bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com\/pilotonline.com\/content\/tncms\/assets\/v3\/editorial\/c\/87\/c8744c79-3fd2-540c-b1ca-b36723d2edac\/5a2eb94762c3e.image.jpg","width":640},"authors":[{"avatar":"https:\/\/pilotonline.com\/pilotonline.com\/content\/tncms\/avatars\/f\/b1\/3c7\/fb13c7a8-d1e9-11e6-96b9-c79f57b8e432.bef9195cdcf822ef16c0b7c8e2b6c385.png","byline":null,"first_name":"Judy","last_name":"Cowling","screen_name":"Judy Cowling","uuid":"fb13c7a8-d1e9-11e6-96b9-c79f57b8e432"}],"prologue":"","subheadline":"","tagline":"<p>Send tips to Judy Cowling at turningtables@pilotonline.com.<\/p>","byline":"By Judy Cowling \n<br>Correspondent","hammer":"","kicker":"","content":["<p>Want to make a child\u2019s Christmas a little brighter, warmer and more fun?<\/p>","<p>Executive Chef Eddie Lee Bryant of the Town Point Club has partnered with Blankets for the Homeless in a toy drive for families that could use some help in making some magic for their deserving kids.<\/p>","<p>Bring an unwrapped toy to the third floor of Town Point Club, Suite 300, in the World Trade Center in Norfolk.

The business is growing steadily, although at a much slower pace than 20 years ago.<\/p>","<p>John\u2019s financially set for life and wants to enjoy retirement. Although there\u2019s no immediate hurry, he\u2019s looking to cash out from his company, which is now largely in the hands of his capable daughter.<\/p>","<p>As you might guess, John is an Exiter.<\/p>","<p>At a social function, John strikes up a conversation with a husband-and-wife team named Jason and Tara who run a fledgling software company of their own, although they aren\u2019t direct competitors. Jason and Tara have just won a significant contract and their products are receiving good reviews, but they need capital to meet their demands.<\/p>","<p>These classic Growers ask John for advice, figuring (correctly) he\u2019s seen it all. So what does John tell them?<\/p>","<p>An aggressive businessman all his life, John essentially tells Jason and Tara to be bold \u2013 which is the only way to successfully get through each individual entrepreneurial cycle.<\/p>","<p>GROWERS<\/p>","<p>A Grower is the type of entrepreneur typically depicted in film, on television, in books and all other forms of media. These are the businesspeople looking to expand their operations, often rapidly. They generally have a healthy appetite for assuming risk and are loaded with self-confidence.<\/p>","<p>John tests Jason and Tara by asking them what they\u2019d do if they received a $1 million gift. Would they invest all (or most) of that money directly into their business or would they hold on to it, essentially saving it for a rainy day?<\/p>","<p>John\u2019s happy to hear his newfound friends didn\u2019t hesitate before saying they were confident in their business and figured investing the money would go a long way toward solving their growth issues.<\/p>","<p>While John is speaking, his audience grows, enthralled by the wisdom he\u2019s imparting. One of the listeners is a long-time friend named Mary whose small custom-framing chain of stores is stable and profitable. She is a Glider.<\/p>","<p>GLIDERS<\/p>","<p>Mary tells the group she\u2019s reached a happy point where she\u2019s making a solid amount of money, expects her business to remain sound and is loath to wreck a good thing.<\/p>","<p>John\u2019s been somewhat of a mentor to Mary over the years, so he poses the same hypothetical $1 million gift question he asked Jason and Tara.<\/p>","<p>That led Mary to waffle a bit. She first said she would place a significant chunk of that gift into mutual funds, happy with a smaller return, but still available to be used if need be. After more thought, she decided to put about 75 percent in her business because she realized she was already generating a higher return than what a mutual fund offered.<\/p>","<p>John approved, noting that keeping a business on an even keel is never a bad thing, especially for someone like Mary, who is beginning to consider retirement options. He also pointed out that since her business was doing well, there\u2019d be no shortage of palatable financial options available if the need arose.<\/p>","<p>The conversation lurches in a different direction, however, when a frazzled-looking entrepreneur joins the discussion. That would be Derek, the founder of an online sporting goods store. Derek\u2019s business was growing at a double-digit rate, but he overestimated his market and is now stuck with a warehouse full of unsold goods \u2013 not to mention his bank wants to pull its line of credit and is demanding repayment.<\/p>","<p>Derek, a textbook Speed-bumper, asks John what he should do.<\/p>","<p>SPEED-BUMPERS<\/p>","<p>John points out that a little rain falls on most people\u2019s lives at some point and entrepreneurs aren\u2019t immune.<\/p>","<p>Again, he brings up the hypothetical $1 million gift.<\/p>","<p>It doesn\u2019t take long for Derek to gain clarity when he says he would plunk most or the entire hypothetical $1 million gift into his business. While some non-entrepreneurs might consider that foolish, Derek realizes that for any business to succeed, it requires the stomach for at least some risk along with overriding confidence. By stepping back, he realizes his company and business model are viable and will need some fine tuning.<\/p>","<p>John cautions that challenges might lie ahead because some financial options will be closed to him. And the options that will be open may carry a greater risk (or interest rate) or even the possibility of surrendering some equity.<\/p>","<p>Having provided his sage advice to the others, the group of entrepreneurs questions John about his plans.<\/p>","<p>EXITERS<\/p>","<p>John replies that even the most-fervent entrepreneur will walk away at some point.

That may be even more true for local farmers: In fields all over southeastern Virginia, it\u2019s begun to look a lot like soybean harvest.<\/p>","<p>And the 2017 harvest is expected to be a strong one. Survey statistics show that for at least the third year running, growers in most areas of Virginia are expecting good quality, high yield crops. That general pattern has held true locally.<\/p>","<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve heard consistent yields just north of 50 [bushels per acre],\u201d said Roy Flanagan, Virginia Beach\u2019s agriculture extension agent. By the time the last harvests are brought in, he said, \u201cI think we\u2019ll be in upper 40s average.\u201d<\/p>","<p>That compares favorably to the Beach\u2019s average yield last year of 48 bushels per acre.<\/p>","<p>Flanagan said the Beach\u2019s harvest is also progressing faster than usual. As of the last week of November, he estimated 70 percent of Virginia Beach\u2019s beans were already in. In a typical year, harvest extends into mid-December.<\/p>","<p>Soybeans have been coming in so fast, with so little break between loads, that Flanagan said the two granaries Beach growers usually use ran into an unusual glitch: too much stock and not enough storage.<\/p>","<p>Adjustments to trucking schedules fixed the problem, Flanagan said, and Beach soybean work has since continued in the same positive direction.<\/p>","<p>\u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned it didn\u2019t hurt anybody,\u201d Flanagan said. \u201cJust slowed progress for a minute.\u201d<\/p>","<p>Flanagan attributes both high yield and the relative speed of this year\u2019s harvest to nearly two weeks without significant rain \u2013 what Flanagan called \u201can unprecedented stretch of good harvesting conditions.\u201d It added up to no delays between ready-to-cut fields, waiting for soils to dry out again, just a solid stream of harvest.<\/p>","<p>For Suffolk and Western Tidewater farmers, too, the late-season weather has smiled on soybeans. Virginia Cooperative Extension soybean specialist David Holshouser said many crops were started later than ideal because of soggy spring soils. While some of those late crops never quite recovered, others are looking very good now that harvest is near.<\/p>","<p>But despite those pockets of lesser results, Holshouser said the overall outlook for the 2017 soybean crop is still strong, with some areas showing remarkably good signs.<\/p>","<p>\u201cWe\u2019re pretty excited about the yields this year,\u201d Holshouser said.<\/p>","<p>Like Flanagan, Holshouser said weather is a big factor. But looking at soybeans from a whole-state perspective, he said, there\u2019s a bigger story at work.<\/p>","<p>\u201cRainfall at the right time is almost always responsible for good yields, but improved management is also key,\u201d Holshouser said.<\/p>","<p>Holshouser said a person outside of farming might see \u201cgood yield\u201d and assume this means growers are achieving those numbers by pushing excessive fertilizers and pesticides into crops.<\/p>","<p>\u201cBut actually it\u2019s just the opposite. We\u2019re doing a lot more with less now,\u201d Holshouser said. Looking at environmental quality measurements on a per-square-foot basis, he said, farming actually does better than average.<\/p>","<p>Holshouser said simply choosing the right seed for the land can account for as much as half of the increase in soybean yield year to year.
